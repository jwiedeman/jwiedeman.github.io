        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>I’m Joshua. Easiest way to explain me is I like building stuff that actually works. Doesn’t matter if it’s analytics pipelines, websites, or some random side project, I’ll tear it down, line it up, and make it run clean.</p>
        <p>I don’t really do overcomplication. Most people pile on extra steps; I cut through the noise, figure out what matters, and move. If something’s broken, I fix it. If it’s inefficient, I make it faster. If it’s messy, I clean it up. Simple.</p>
        <p>Right now I’m split between big-league analytics work and my own projects, things that scan, track, optimize, and basically show people how to get more out of what they already have. Long term? I’m aiming at bigger systems: businesses that feed into each other, tech that solves real problems, loops that sustain themselves.</p>
        <p>Outside the screen, I’m into mushrooms, aquaponics, and the whole idea of turning waste into something useful. Also cars, games, geopolitics—if it’s strategy, tech, or just pushing limits, I’ll get into it.</p>
        <p>Short version: I build, I optimize, I experiment. Always forward.</p>
