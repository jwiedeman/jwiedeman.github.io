  <h1>About</h1>

  <section class="flow">
    <h2>Mission</h2>
    <p>Driven by curiosity and a knack for abstract problem solving, I specialize in digital analytics strategy, Adobe Analytics implementation, and Google Tag Manager solutions that perform at scale. I design and deliver data layer architectures, SDK integrations, and cross-platform analytics implementations that meet GDPR, CCPA, HIPAA, and GxP compliance.</p>

    <h2>Approach</h2>
    <p>I'm never afraid to step out of my comfort zone if it means getting a project across the finish line faster and smarter. In one case, a slow BI processing heavy set of reports had myself and multiple engineers refining queries and architecture to optimize within our limits. I looked beyond my scope and found the real cause: the database was on the lowest billing tier. One setting change saved time, budget, and effort.</p>
    <p>That's the abstract thinking and cross-team awareness I bring: questioning assumptions, finding root causes, and applying the fix with the highest impact.</p>

  <section class="flow">
    <h2>Experience</h2>
    <p>I've led enterprise analytics deployments across web, mobile, OTT, and server-side environments, building event tracking frameworks, automation pipelines, and QA processes that make data accurate, actionable, and BI-ready. I bridge the gap between technical implementation and business outcomes, ensuring analytics, data engineering, BI, and compliance teams get exactly what they need.</p>

    <p>Outside of work, you'll find me kayaking, foraging for mushrooms, or studying cultures, subcultures, and belief systems—the same curiosity that drives my technical work.</p>
