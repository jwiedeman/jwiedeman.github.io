  <h1>About</h1>
  <p>Driven by curiosity and a knack for abstract problem solving, I specialize in digital analytics strategy, Adobe Analytics implementation, and Google Tag Manager (GTM) solutions that perform at scale. I design and deliver data layer architectures, SDK integrations, and cross-platform analytics implementations that meet GDPR, CCPA, HIPAA, and GxP compliance.</p>
  <p>I’m never afraid to step out of my comfort zone if it means getting a project across the finish line faster and smarter. In one case, a slow BI processing heavy set of reports had myself and multiple engineers refining queries and architecture to optimize within our limits. I looked beyond my scope and found the real cause, the database was on the lowest billing tier. One setting change saved time, budget, and effort. That’s the abstract thinking and cross-team awareness I bring: questioning assumptions, finding root causes, and applying the fix with the highest impact.</p>
  <p>I’ve led enterprise analytics deployments across web, mobile, OTT, and server-side environments, building event tracking frameworks, automation pipelines, and QA processes that make data accurate, actionable, and BI-ready. I bridge the gap between technical implementation and business outcomes, ensuring analytics, data engineering, BI, and compliance teams get exactly what they need.</p>
  <p>Core strengths:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Architecting &amp; deploying Adobe Analytics, GA4, and server-side GTM</li>
    <li>Creating custom data layers, JavaScript tracking scripts, and API-based event ingestion</li>
    <li>Automating tag audits and validation for scale and accuracy</li>
    <li>Supporting BI &amp; Data Engineering with clean, governed data</li>
    <li>Advising on analytics compliance in pharma, media, government, and enterprise</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Outside of work, you’ll find me kayaking, foraging for mushrooms, or studying cultures, subcultures, and belief systems, the same curiosity that drives my technical work.</p>
