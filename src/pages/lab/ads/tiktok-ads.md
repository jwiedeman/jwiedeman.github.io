  <h1>TikTok Ads Launch Kit</h1>
  <p class="intro">TikTok’s algorithm thrives on creative velocity and strong conversion signals. This kit covers how to prepare assets, partner with creators, and ensure measurement fidelity.</p>

  <section>
    <h2>Flight plan</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Segment campaigns by objective: Reach, Traffic, Lead, App Install, or Conversion. Avoid mixing optimization events within one campaign.</li>
      <li>Adopt ad group naming: <span class="mono">[Objective]-[Audience]-[Offer]-[Iteration]</span>.</li>
      <li>Enable automated creative optimization for discovery flights; use manual placements for retargeting.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Creative operating system</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Maintain a creative sprint cadence: drop 3-5 new assets each week. Use the “3-second hook, 15-second story, 3-second CTA” framework.</li>
      <li>Leverage Spark Ads to whitelist top-performing organic posts or creator collaborations.</li>
      <li>Generate scripts and storyboards with clear product demos, native captions, and trending audio guidance.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Creator and community strategy</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Source creators through TikTok Creator Marketplace or vetted agencies; capture usage rights durations in contracts.</li>
      <li>Provide creative briefs with mission goals, messaging pillars, and compliance guardrails.</li>
      <li>Monitor comments for product questions and respond within 1 hour during launch windows.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Pixel, events, and API</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Install TikTok Pixel via GTM and map standard events (ViewContent, AddToCart, CompletePayment, SubmitForm).</li>
      <li>Enable Advanced Matching and Conversions API (Events API) for deduplication and improved attribution.</li>
      <li>Test events using the TikTok Events Manager diagnostics prior to go-live.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Optimization and reporting</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Daily:</strong> Monitor learning phase and CPA fluctuations; pause underperforming creatives with low view-through rate.</li>
      <li><strong>Weekly:</strong> Review creative insights (hook rate, 6s view rate) and refresh assets accordingly.</li>
      <li><strong>Monthly:</strong> Evaluate conversion lift or brand lift studies to benchmark incremental impact.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Pre-launch checklist</h2>

      <li>Creator usage rights documented, Spark Ad codes collected.</li>
