# Whitelisting & Licensing

Whitelisting (also called creator licensing or Spark Ads) is the practice of running paid advertisements through an influencer's social media account with their explicit permission. Instead of your brand's ad account serving the creative, the ad appears to come directly from the creator's profile. This combines the authenticity of influencer content with the targeting precision and scalability of paid media.

## Core Concept

Whitelisted ads outperform brand-run creative because they inherit the creator's social proof — their profile picture, handle, follower count, and existing engagement all appear in the ad unit. The algorithm also tends to favor these ads because they look like native content rather than polished advertisements. On Meta, this is done through Business Manager partnerships; on TikTok, through Spark Ads codes.

## Implementation

1. Negotiate whitelisting rights during the initial creator contract — specify the platforms (Meta, TikTok), the duration of ad usage rights (typically 30-90 days), and whether you can modify the creative (add captions, trim length, change CTA) or must run it as-is.
2. On Meta, have the influencer grant your Business Manager advertising access to their Instagram or Facebook page through Business Settings, then connect their page to your ad account for running ads under their handle.
3. On TikTok, request a Spark Ads authorization code from the creator — they generate this in the TikTok app under Privacy Settings and Ad Authorization, set the duration, and share the code which you then apply to your TikTok Ads Manager campaign.
4. Launch the whitelisted content as dark posts (ads that do not appear on the creator's organic feed) with your standard audience targeting, starting with broad interest-based audiences before layering in lookalikes and retargeting — test 3-5 creator assets simultaneously.
5. Monitor performance daily for the first week, comparing whitelisted creator ads against your brand-produced ads on CPA, CTR, and thumb-stop rate — scale budget toward winning creator assets and request similar content styles from other creators.

## Key Metrics

- **Thumb-Stop Rate** — the percentage of users who pause scrolling to watch the ad for at least 3 seconds, which is typically 30-50% higher for whitelisted content versus polished brand creative
- **Cost Per Acquisition (CPA)** — whitelisted ads frequently deliver 20-50% lower CPAs than brand-account ads because they generate higher engagement and relevance scores
- **Creative Fatigue Timeline** — how many days until the ad's CPA rises above your threshold, which determines when to rotate in new whitelisted content (benchmark: 14-21 days for strong performers)

## Best Practices

- Secure usage rights for longer than you think you need — a 90-day window gives you room to relaunch top performers in new campaigns, and renegotiating mid-flight is expensive and disruptive
- Run whitelisted content as dark posts rather than boosting organic posts, because dark posts give you full control over targeting, bidding, and placement without affecting the creator's organic feed
- Brief creators specifically for whitelisted content by requesting raw, unpolished footage with strong hooks in the first 2 seconds — content that looks too produced defeats the purpose of whitelisting

## Common Pitfalls

- Failing to get written whitelisting permission in the contract and then having a creator revoke access mid-campaign, killing your best-performing ad with no recourse
- Over-editing whitelisted content with brand overlays, logos, and text that makes it look like a traditional ad — the entire point is that it looks like a native creator post
- Not factoring whitelisting fees into your influencer budget — most experienced creators charge 1.5-3x their organic post rate for whitelisting rights because they are lending their identity to paid ads
