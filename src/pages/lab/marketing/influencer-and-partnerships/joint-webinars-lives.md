# Joint Webinars & Lives

Joint webinars and live events involve partnering with a complementary brand or industry expert to co-host educational or entertaining live content. Each partner promotes the event to their respective audience, effectively doubling your reach without doubling your spend. The live format creates urgency and engagement that pre-recorded content cannot match, while the co-hosting dynamic adds credibility and variety that keeps audiences engaged longer.

## Core Concept

The mechanism behind joint lives is audience arbitrage — you get access to your partner's email list and social following in exchange for giving them access to yours. Because the event delivers genuine value (education, entertainment, exclusive access), both audiences perceive it as content rather than cross-promotion. The live component creates a time-bound event that drives registrations (lead capture) and real-time engagement that builds stronger relationships than passive content consumption.

## Implementation

1. Identify a co-host partner whose audience overlaps 30-50% with yours in demographics but less than 10% in actual contacts — use tools like SparkToro to compare audience interests, or simply ask your partner how many of their subscribers have heard of you to gauge overlap.
2. Choose a topic that sits at the intersection of both brands' expertise and directly addresses a pain point your shared audience faces — the topic should be specific enough to attract qualified leads (e.g., "5 Email Automations That Recover Abandoned Carts" not "How to Do Email Marketing").
3. Build a shared registration page using your webinar platform (Zoom Webinar, Demio, StreamYard) with both brands' logos, a compelling title, 3-4 bullet points of what attendees will learn, and a registration form that captures name, email, and one qualifying question.
4. Execute a 4-week promotional cadence: Week 1 — announce on social and first email blast; Week 2 — share behind-the-scenes prep content; Week 3 — partner cross-promotion and "seats filling up" email; Week 4 — day-before and day-of reminder emails to maximize show-up rate.
5. During the live event, deliver 80% educational value and 20% soft promotion — include interactive elements every 5-7 minutes (polls, Q&A, chat prompts) to maintain engagement, and close with a co-branded offer exclusive to attendees that expires within 48 hours.

## Key Metrics

- **Registration-to-Attendee Rate** — the percentage of registrants who actually show up live (benchmark: 35-45% for well-promoted joint webinars), which indicates how compelling your topic and promotion were
- **New Email Subscribers Acquired** — the number of registrants who came from your partner's audience and are now in your database, which is the primary acquisition value of the partnership
- **Post-Event Conversion Rate** — the percentage of attendees who take the desired next action (purchase, trial signup, demo request) within 7 days of the event, which measures content quality and offer relevance

## Best Practices

- Agree on a shared lead list policy before promotion begins — both partners typically get access to all registrant emails, but some partners prefer to share only engaged attendees (those who showed up live), so clarify this upfront
- Record the session and repurpose it into 5-10 short-form content clips, a blog post recap, a podcast episode, and an email nurture series — the live event is the starting point, not the end product
- Schedule the event on a Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday at 11am-1pm in your primary audience's timezone — these windows consistently outperform other days and times for B2B webinar attendance

## Common Pitfalls

- Choosing a partner based on brand prestige rather than audience relevance — a joint webinar with a famous brand whose audience does not match yours will generate vanity registrations but zero qualified leads
- Making the live event too long (over 60 minutes) or too sales-heavy — attention drops sharply after 45 minutes, and if attendees feel pitched before receiving value, they will leave and unsubscribe
- Neglecting the post-event follow-up sequence — the highest-intent leads are those who attended and engaged but did not convert immediately; a 3-5 email nurture sequence within 7 days captures the long tail of conversions
