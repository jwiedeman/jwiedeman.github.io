# TOFU/MOFU/BOFU Campaign Structure

Splitting your paid media campaigns by funnel stage — Top of Funnel (TOFU), Middle of Funnel (MOFU), and Bottom of Funnel (BOFU) — lets you match ad creative, bidding, and targeting to where the buyer actually is in their decision process. Without this structure, you end up serving hard-sell ads to cold audiences and awareness content to people ready to buy, wasting budget in both directions.

## Core Concept

Each funnel stage represents a different level of buyer awareness and intent. TOFU campaigns introduce your brand to cold audiences who don't know they have a problem yet. MOFU campaigns nurture warm audiences who are evaluating solutions. BOFU campaigns close hot audiences who are comparing vendors or ready to purchase. The key insight is that each stage requires different creative, different calls to action, different landing pages, and often different bid strategies — treating them as one campaign guarantees suboptimal performance.

## Implementation

1. **Audit your existing campaigns and segment them** — Tag every active campaign as TOFU, MOFU, or BOFU based on the audience it targets and the action it asks for. Most advertisers discover 80%+ of spend is concentrated in one stage.
2. **Define your TOFU layer** — Build campaigns targeting cold audiences (interests, broad targeting, lookalikes of page engagers) with educational or entertaining content. Optimize for cheap engagement signals: video views, post engagement, or landing page views. Use CPM or ThruPlay bidding.
3. **Build your MOFU layer** — Create campaigns targeting warm audiences (video viewers 50%+, website visitors 7-30 days, email subscribers who haven't purchased). Serve comparison guides, case studies, webinars, or product demos. Optimize for lead generation or content consumption.
4. **Set up your BOFU layer** — Target hot audiences (add-to-cart abandoners, pricing page visitors, free trial users, high-intent remarketing pools). Use direct-response creative with urgency, social proof, and clear CTAs. Optimize for purchases or qualified leads with target CPA or ROAS bidding.
5. **Allocate budget by stage and measure flow-through** — Start with a 60/20/20 split (TOFU/MOFU/BOFU) and adjust based on how efficiently audiences move between stages. Track the cost to move a user from one stage to the next, not just the final conversion cost.

## Key Metrics

- **Cost Per Funnel Stage Transition** — How much it costs to move a user from TOFU audience to MOFU audience (e.g., cost per 50% video viewer, cost per website visitor)
- **Stage-to-Stage Conversion Rate** — The percentage of TOFU audience members who become MOFU, and MOFU who become BOFU, revealing where your funnel leaks
- **Blended CAC vs. BOFU-Only CAC** — Comparing the true cost including upper-funnel investment against BOFU-only metrics prevents the illusion that retargeting is "cheap" when it depends on TOFU spend to fill the pool

## Best Practices

- Keep audience exclusions tight — exclude MOFU audiences from TOFU campaigns and BOFU audiences from MOFU campaigns to prevent double-serving and inflated frequency
- Refresh TOFU creative every 2-3 weeks since cold audiences burn out fastest; BOFU creative can run longer because the audience pool constantly refreshes from upstream
- Use sequential messaging so that MOFU creative references what TOFU exposed them to (e.g., "Remember that stat about X? Here's how we solve it")

## Common Pitfalls

- Starving TOFU to fund BOFU — Retargeting pools shrink over time without fresh top-of-funnel input, leading to rising costs and audience fatigue in your highest-intent campaigns
- Using the same creative across all stages — A testimonial ad works at BOFU but falls flat at TOFU where the audience has no context for who your customer is or why they should care
- Judging TOFU campaigns by BOFU metrics — Expecting direct conversions from awareness campaigns leads to killing the campaigns that feed your entire funnel
