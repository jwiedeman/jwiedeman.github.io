# Lead Magnet to Tripwire Funnel

The lead magnet to tripwire funnel is a two-step conversion strategy that moves cold traffic from stranger to buyer in the lowest-friction way possible. First, you offer something genuinely valuable for free (the lead magnet) in exchange for an email address. Then, immediately after opt-in, you present a low-priced product ($7-$47) that solves a related problem (the tripwire). The psychology is simple: someone who has spent even $7 with you is 10x more likely to buy your core offer than someone who only downloaded a free PDF.

## Core Concept

The fundamental barrier in customer acquisition isn't awareness — it's the first transaction. A lead magnet removes the financial barrier to get someone into your ecosystem, but a free opt-in creates a "freeloader" mindset. The tripwire offer immediately after opt-in converts that freeloader into a buyer while their engagement is at peak levels. Once someone has entered their credit card and completed a purchase — no matter how small — they've psychologically committed to your brand. Your backend email sequence then ascends them to your core product. The tripwire often breaks even on ad spend, making your email list growth effectively free.

## Implementation

1. **Create a lead magnet that solves a specific, urgent problem** — The best lead magnets are not comprehensive guides; they solve one painful problem quickly. Templates, checklists, swipe files, and calculators outperform ebooks because they deliver immediate value. The lead magnet should be directly related to the problem your core product solves, so the audience that opts in is pre-qualified for your paid offers.
2. **Build the tripwire offer** — Your tripwire should be a logical next step from the lead magnet. If the lead magnet is a "Facebook Ad Copy Template Pack," the tripwire might be a $17 video training on "How to Write Hooks That Stop the Scroll." Price it low enough that the purchase decision is impulsive ($7-$47), and deliver it digitally so margins are near 100%.
3. **Design the funnel pages** — You need: a lead magnet landing page (headline, bullet points, opt-in form), a thank-you/tripwire page (delivered immediately after opt-in, before they leave), and an order confirmation page with a one-time upsell to your core product. The tripwire page should feel like a natural continuation, not a bait-and-switch.
4. **Set up your ad campaigns and tracking** — Run TOFU ads driving to the lead magnet landing page. Optimize for leads (opt-ins), not purchases, since the tripwire conversion happens on-page. Track the full funnel: cost per lead, lead-to-tripwire conversion rate, tripwire revenue, and downstream LTV from tripwire buyers.
5. **Build the backend email ascension sequence** — Tripwire buyers should receive a 5-7 email sequence over 10-14 days that delivers value, builds trust, and presents your core offer. Lead magnet-only subscribers get a parallel nurture sequence. Segment these two groups and track conversion rates separately — tripwire buyers will convert to your core offer at 3-5x the rate of lead-only subscribers.

## Key Metrics

- **Cost Per Lead (CPL)** — The ad spend required to generate each email opt-in, which determines whether the funnel math works; healthy CPLs range from $1-$8 depending on industry
- **Tripwire Take Rate** — The percentage of lead magnet downloaders who purchase the tripwire offer on the thank-you page; 5-15% is typical, below 3% means your tripwire offer or page needs work
- **Front-End ROAS** — Revenue from tripwire sales divided by ad spend; if this is above 0.8x, your list growth is nearly free since email revenue will push total ROAS well above breakeven

## Best Practices

- Make the tripwire offer time-sensitive on the thank-you page — "This $17 offer is only available right now" creates urgency that doubles take rates compared to an evergreen offer
- Ensure the lead magnet, tripwire, and core product form a logical value ladder where each step naturally leads to the next; discontinuity between steps kills conversion rates
- Test different tripwire price points — sometimes a $7 offer converts 3x more than a $27 offer but generates less total revenue; calculate total funnel value, not just take rate

## Common Pitfalls

- Creating a lead magnet that attracts the wrong audience — A generic "Marketing Tips" PDF attracts everyone but qualifies no one; specificity in your lead magnet determines the quality of your entire funnel
- Making the tripwire too similar to the lead magnet — If people feel like they got enough value from the free resource, they won't pay for more; the tripwire should solve a different (but related) problem
- Neglecting the email sequence — The real money is in the backend; teams that obsess over the front-end funnel but send generic emails to tripwire buyers leave 80% of the revenue on the table
