# Seasonal & Event Hijacks

Seasonal and event hijacking means timing your paid media campaigns to ride the wave of existing cultural attention — holidays, sporting events, award shows, industry conferences, back-to-school season, and viral cultural moments. Instead of creating demand from scratch, you insert your brand into a conversation people are already having. When done well, this strategy lowers CPMs (because platform inventory expands during high-engagement moments) and increases CTRs (because your ad feels relevant to what's top-of-mind).

## Core Concept

Attention is a finite resource, and cultural events temporarily concentrate it around specific themes. When millions of people are thinking about the Super Bowl, New Year's resolutions, or back-to-school shopping, ads that connect to those themes feel native rather than interruptive. The mechanism works on two levels: contextual relevance (your ad matches what people are already thinking about) and emotional alignment (your ad taps into the feelings associated with the event — nostalgia, excitement, urgency). The key is connecting your product to the event in a way that feels natural, not forced.

## Implementation

1. **Build an annual event calendar** — Map every relevant cultural moment for your audience across the year: major holidays, industry events, seasonal transitions, sporting events, award shows, school calendars, and shopping events (Prime Day, Black Friday, Singles' Day). Include ramp-up dates, since campaigns should launch 7-14 days before the event peaks.
2. **Identify natural product-event connections** — For each event, ask: "How does our product relate to what people feel, want, or need during this moment?" A fitness brand connects naturally to New Year's resolutions. A skincare brand connects to summer. But even non-obvious connections work — a B2B SaaS company can run "New Year, New Systems" campaigns in January or "Back to Business" campaigns after summer.
3. **Create event-specific creative and landing pages** — Swap in seasonal visuals, headlines, and offers. Don't just slap a holiday graphic on your existing ad — rewrite the hook to reference the event, adjust the value proposition to match seasonal needs, and create a landing page that carries the theme through to conversion. A "Summer Sale" ad that lands on a generic product page breaks the experience.
4. **Adjust bidding and budgets for seasonal dynamics** — CPMs spike during peak shopping periods (Black Friday, Christmas) but drop during attention-rich non-commercial events (Super Bowl, Oscars). Front-load budget before competition peaks — launching your holiday campaigns in early November costs less than launching Thanksgiving week. Set up automated rules to increase budgets when performance exceeds targets during high-traffic periods.
5. **Build a rapid-response playbook for unplanned moments** — Not all hijackable events are on the calendar. Viral cultural moments, unexpected news events, and trending topics create windows of 24-72 hours. Have pre-approved creative templates, simplified approval workflows, and dedicated budget reserves ready so you can launch within hours, not days.

## Key Metrics

- **Seasonal CPM vs. Baseline CPM** — Compare your cost per thousand impressions during event periods against your non-seasonal baseline to understand whether the event is making inventory cheaper or more expensive
- **Event-Period Conversion Rate Lift** — The percentage increase in conversion rate during event campaigns versus your evergreen campaigns, isolating the impact of seasonal relevance
- **Revenue Per Event** — Track total revenue and ROAS for each seasonal campaign to build historical benchmarks; this data becomes your planning tool for allocating next year's seasonal budgets

## Best Practices

- Start campaigns 7-14 days before the event peaks — early movers get lower CPMs and establish frequency before the event-day ad inventory crunch
- Test multiple event angles in the same campaign; for Valentine's Day, test "gift for partner" vs. "self-love treat" vs. "Galentine's Day" angles simultaneously
- Maintain a "seasonal swipe file" of competitors' past event campaigns so you can differentiate instead of running the same tired holiday creative everyone else uses

## Common Pitfalls

- Forcing a connection that doesn't exist — If your product has no natural link to the event, the campaign feels cringey and performative; not every brand needs a Super Bowl tie-in
- Starting too late — By the time the event arrives, CPMs are peak and competitors have saturated the audience; the planning window for major seasonal campaigns should be 6-8 weeks
- Ignoring post-event cleanup — Leaving seasonal creative running after the moment passes (Valentine's Day ads on February 15th) looks sloppy and wastes budget on irrelevant messaging
