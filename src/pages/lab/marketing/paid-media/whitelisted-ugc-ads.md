# Whitelisted UGC Ads

Whitelisted UGC ads (also called creator licensing or spark ads) let you run paid media through a creator's social account instead of your brand's. The ad appears in feeds as if the creator posted it organically, complete with their profile photo, handle, and follower count — but you control the targeting, budget, and optimization. This format consistently outperforms brand-account ads because users scroll past polished brand content but stop for authentic creator content.

## Core Concept

Whitelisting bridges the gap between organic influencer content and paid advertising. When a creator grants your brand advertising permissions on their account, you can take their organic post (or a custom piece they film for you) and run it as a paid ad to audiences far beyond their followers. The ad inherits the creator's social proof — their profile, their engagement, their authenticity — while you get full control over targeting, spend, and measurement. On Meta this works through branded content ads and the Business Suite partnership system. On TikTok, Spark Ads achieve the same effect natively. The result is paid ads that don't look or feel like paid ads.

## Implementation

1. **Source creators who match your customer profile** — Look for creators whose audience demographics mirror your buyer persona, not just those with the most followers. Micro-creators (10K-100K followers) often deliver better performance because their audiences are more engaged and niche-relevant. Use platforms like Aspire, CreatorIQ, or manual outreach to find partners.
2. **Brief creators for performance, not just brand** — UGC ad creative needs a strong hook in the first 1-2 seconds, a clear problem-solution narrative, and a natural CTA. Provide creators with a brief that includes: the hook angle, key talking points, product demonstration requirements, and CTA language. Let them deliver the content in their own voice and style — over-scripting kills authenticity.
3. **Set up whitelisting permissions** — On Meta, the creator adds your business as a partner via Instagram Settings > Business > Branded Content, then you create a branded content ad using their post. On TikTok, the creator generates a Spark Ad authorization code from their post, which you enter when creating the ad. Each platform has a slightly different flow, so send creators a step-by-step guide specific to the platform.
4. **Run the UGC ad with your standard paid media structure** — Target it like any other acquisition ad — lookalikes, broad targeting, or interest-based audiences. Test multiple creator videos against each other and against your brand-account creative. Let the algorithm optimize delivery while you compare performance.
5. **Manage rights, renewals, and payments** — Get written agreements covering: usage rights duration (typically 60-90 days), which platforms you can run on, whether you can edit the content, and payment terms. Track expiration dates and either renew or pull the ads when rights expire. Build a pipeline of creator content so you always have fresh material in rotation.

## Key Metrics

- **Thumb-Stop Rate (Hook Rate)** — The percentage of users who watch at least 3 seconds after the ad enters their viewport; whitelisted UGC typically achieves 30-50% higher hook rates than brand-account creative
- **CPA: Whitelisted UGC vs. Brand Creative** — The direct performance comparison that justifies the creator investment; track this at the ad level within the same campaign to eliminate audience and bidding variables
- **Content Fatigue Timeline** — How many days or impressions before the whitelisted ad's performance degrades; UGC tends to last longer than polished brand creative but still needs replacement every 3-6 weeks

## Best Practices

- Test multiple creators for the same product and let performance data pick the winner — the creator you think will perform best is often not the one who actually drives the most conversions
- Negotiate usage rights for paid media separately from organic posting; many creators charge 2-5x their organic rate for whitelisting because your spend amplifies their content to millions
- Request raw footage in addition to the finished video so you can create multiple edits (different hooks, different lengths, different CTAs) from a single creator shoot

## Common Pitfalls

- Choosing creators based on follower count instead of audience fit — A 500K fitness influencer will underperform a 20K creator in your exact niche because the audience overlap with your customer profile is what matters
- Over-polishing the content — The whole point of UGC is that it looks native and authentic; adding branded intros, logo overlays, or studio-quality editing defeats the purpose and tanks performance
- Letting rights expire while ads are still running — This creates legal exposure and damaged creator relationships; build a tracking system that alerts you 7 days before any usage rights expire
