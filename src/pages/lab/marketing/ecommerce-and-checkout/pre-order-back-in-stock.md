# Pre-Order & Back-in-Stock

Pre-order and back-in-stock notification systems capture purchase intent from customers when a product is not yet available or temporarily sold out, then convert that intent into revenue when the product becomes available. Back-in-stock emails convert at 8-15% — among the highest of any email type — because they reach a customer who already wanted to buy and are timed to the moment they can. Pre-orders generate guaranteed revenue before production or shipping, improving cash flow and demand forecasting.

## Core Concept

Out-of-stock pages are one of the biggest missed opportunities in ecommerce. Without a capture mechanism, every visitor who encounters a sold-out product bounces and may never return. A back-in-stock notification converts that lost visit into a warm lead that can be reactivated with a single automated message. Pre-orders go further by letting customers commit and pay (or reserve) before the product ships, turning future demand into present revenue. Both mechanisms transform a dead page into a demand capture engine.

## Implementation

1. **Replace "Sold Out" with a notification signup:** On every out-of-stock product page, replace the disabled add-to-cart button with an email/SMS capture form: "Notify me when this is back in stock." Collect the customer's email or phone number and the specific product/variant they want. Display the number of people already on the waitlist to create urgency.
2. **Build the back-in-stock automation:** When inventory is restocked, trigger an automated email and/or SMS to everyone on the waitlist. The message should be immediate (within minutes of restock), include the product image and a direct add-to-cart link, and create urgency: "Back in stock — limited quantities available." Send to SMS subscribers first (higher open rate), then email 30 minutes later.
3. **Implement pre-order functionality:** For upcoming products, enable a "Pre-Order" button that either charges the full amount immediately (with a clear estimated ship date) or collects a deposit with the balance charged at shipment. Display the ship date prominently and send order confirmation with delivery expectations.
4. **Manage waitlist expectations:** Send a confirmation email when someone joins the waitlist with an estimated restock timeline if available. If the restock is delayed, send an update — silence breeds cancellations. For pre-orders, send periodic updates on production status so customers do not feel forgotten.
5. **Analyze demand signals from waitlist data:** Track which products generate the most waitlist signups, which variants sell out fastest, and which customers are repeatedly hitting out-of-stock pages. Feed this data into inventory planning to reduce future stockouts and into merchandising to prioritize high-demand products.

## Key Metrics

- **Waitlist Signup Rate** — percentage of visitors to out-of-stock pages who submit their email for notification; target 10-20% with a well-designed capture form
- **Back-in-Stock Conversion Rate** — percentage of notified customers who purchase within 48 hours of the notification; benchmark is 8-15%, significantly higher than standard email campaigns
- **Pre-Order Revenue as Percentage of Launch Revenue** — pre-orders should represent 20-40% of first-week sales for anticipated products, providing a revenue floor and demand signal

## Best Practices

- Send the back-in-stock notification as soon as inventory is available — delay of even a few hours risks the customer finding an alternative. Automate the trigger directly from your inventory management system.
- Include urgency in the notification — "Only 47 units restocked" or "Last time, this sold out in 3 days" motivates immediate action and is typically accurate for popular products
- Offer waitlisted customers a brief exclusive window — give them 2-4 hours of access before the product goes live to the general public. This rewards their patience and increases conversion.
- Use waitlist data to negotiate with suppliers — "We have 500 people waiting for this product" is powerful leverage for increasing order quantities or expediting production timelines

## Common Pitfalls

- Leaving out-of-stock pages as dead ends — every product page without a notification capture form is leaking demand that you can never recover. Even low-traffic products should have the option.
- Sending back-in-stock emails to customers who already bought the product elsewhere — deduplicate against recent purchases before sending. A notification for a product someone already owns is a waste and a negative signal.
- Taking pre-order money without clear communication about timing — if a pre-order says "Ships in 4-6 weeks" and takes 12 weeks, you will face chargebacks, negative reviews, and customer support floods. Under-promise and over-deliver on pre-order timelines.
