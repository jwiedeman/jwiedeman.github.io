# Tracking Page Upsells

Tracking page upsells transform the order tracking experience — one of the most frequently visited post-purchase pages — into a revenue-generating channel by displaying personalized product recommendations, exclusive offers, and cross-sell opportunities alongside shipment status. Customers check their tracking page an average of 3-4 times per order, creating 3-4 high-intent touchpoints that most brands waste on a plain carrier tracking page. Brands using branded tracking pages with upsells see 8-12% of tracking page visitors making an additional purchase.

## Core Concept

After placing an order, customers are in a uniquely receptive state: they are excited about their purchase, they trust your brand (they just gave you money), and they are actively returning to your site to check on their order. This combination of positive sentiment and repeat visits makes the tracking page one of the highest-converting surfaces in your entire ecommerce experience. By replacing the default carrier tracking page (FedEx, UPS) with a branded tracking page hosted on your domain, you retain the traffic and the engagement, creating opportunities for upsells, cross-sells, referrals, and content delivery.

## Implementation

1. **Build or adopt a branded tracking page:** Replace default carrier tracking links in your shipping confirmation emails with a branded tracking page on your domain. Use platforms like Malomo, Aftership, or Narvar to create a tracking experience that matches your brand design and includes customizable content blocks alongside the shipment status.
2. **Add personalized product recommendations:** Display 3-6 product recommendations based on the customer's purchase history and the specific items in their current order. "Customers who bought [their product] also loved..." or "Complete your [category] collection with..." Recommendations should update based on what the customer has purchased and what they have not.
3. **Include a time-sensitive offer:** Add a post-purchase exclusive discount — "10% off your next order, valid for 7 days" — visible on the tracking page. The urgency of a short deadline combined with the repeated visits to the tracking page creates multiple exposure points for the offer before it expires.
4. **Add content and brand-building elements:** Use the tracking page to deliver value beyond shopping — care instructions for the product they ordered, a welcome video from the founder, links to relevant blog content or how-to guides, and social media follow CTAs. This content deepens the brand relationship during the high-engagement window.
5. **Test and optimize page elements:** A/B test the placement of product recommendations (above vs. below the tracking info), the discount amount and expiration period, the number of products shown, and the addition of reviews or UGC. Track click-through rate, add-to-cart rate, and conversion rate from the tracking page specifically.

## Key Metrics

- **Tracking Page Revenue Per Visit** — total revenue generated from tracking page upsells divided by total tracking page visits; benchmark is $0.50-$2.00 per visit
- **Repeat Purchase Rate (14-day)** — percentage of customers who make a second purchase within 14 days of their first order, segmented by branded tracking page visitors vs. non-visitors
- **Tracking Page Visit Frequency** — average number of visits to the tracking page per order; 3-4 visits is typical, each representing an upsell opportunity

## Best Practices

- Keep the tracking information prominent at the top — the customer came to check their order status. If they have to scroll past a wall of product recommendations to find their tracking number, the experience is frustrating, not valuable. Lead with status, follow with recommendations.
- Personalize recommendations based on the ordered product, not generic best-sellers — if someone ordered running shoes, recommend running socks and insoles, not unrelated categories. Relevance drives click-through.
- Include a referral prompt — the tracking page visit window is when brand enthusiasm is highest. A "Share 15% off with a friend" referral module on the tracking page captures advocacy at the peak moment.
- Update the page content based on shipment status — pre-shipment shows a countdown and product education; in-transit shows delivery expectations and upsells; delivered shows review requests and replenishment recommendations

## Common Pitfalls

- Making the tracking page feel like a store page rather than a tracking page — the primary purpose is shipment information. If the page feels like a thinly disguised sales pitch, customers lose trust. Balance is essential.
- Not redirecting carrier tracking emails to your branded page — if the shipping confirmation email links to fedex.com instead of your tracking page, you lose 100% of the upsell opportunity. Update transactional email templates.
- Showing the same recommendations on every visit — if the customer visits the tracking page 4 times and sees the same 6 products each time, the recommendations become invisible. Rotate or adjust suggestions between visits.
