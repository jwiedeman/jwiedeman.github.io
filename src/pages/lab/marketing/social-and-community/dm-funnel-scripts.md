# DM Funnel Scripts

DM funnel scripts are structured conversation frameworks for qualifying leads and driving conversions through direct messages on Instagram, LinkedIn, Twitter/X, and Facebook Messenger. Instead of random, inconsistent DM outreach, you follow a scripted conversation flow that qualifies the prospect's fit, builds rapport, identifies their specific need, and presents the right offer — all within 3-5 messages. When combined with engagement-triggered automation (someone comments a keyword and receives an automated first DM), this tactic scales personal selling into a repeatable marketing channel.

## Core Concept

Social DMs occupy a unique position in the marketing funnel — they're more personal than email but less formal than a sales call. This middle ground creates an environment where prospects are more likely to engage honestly about their needs and objections. DM funnel scripts work because they apply the structure of a proven sales conversation (open, qualify, diagnose, prescribe, close) to the casual, conversational format of direct messaging. The key is making scripted conversations feel natural — rigid, robotic messages kill the format, while genuinely conversational scripts that follow a strategic framework convert consistently.

## Implementation

1. **Design conversation triggers that initiate the DM** — The best DM funnels start with an inbound trigger, not cold outreach. Common triggers: someone comments a specific keyword on your post ("Comment GUIDE to get the free checklist"), someone engages with your story poll or quiz, someone follows you after viewing a piece of content, or someone sends a message in response to a story CTA. Inbound triggers ensure the prospect is warm and opted-in, making the conversation welcome rather than intrusive.
2. **Write the qualifying script (3-5 message flow)** — Message 1 (Acknowledge + Deliver): "Hey [Name]! Here's that guide you asked for [link]. Quick question — are you [persona A] or [persona B]?" Message 2 (Qualify): Based on their response, ask one qualifying question — "Are you currently [doing the thing your product helps with]?" Message 3 (Diagnose): Based on qualification, identify their specific pain — "Most [persona A] I talk to are struggling with [specific pain]. Is that what you're running into?" Message 4 (Prescribe): "We actually have a [resource/offer/product] that specifically helps with that. Want me to send details?" Message 5 (Close/CTA): Share the relevant link, booking page, or offer.
3. **Set up automation for scale** — Use tools like ManyChat (Instagram, Facebook), LinkedIn Sales Navigator (LinkedIn), or custom integrations to automate the first 1-2 messages and route conversations to a human for qualification and closing. The comment-to-DM trigger can be fully automated: someone comments "GUIDE" on your post, ManyChat sends the automated first DM with the resource and qualifying question. Human takes over for messages 2-5.
4. **Build script variants for different segments** — Create separate scripts for different personas, products, and entry points. Someone who commented on a post about beginner tips needs a different conversation than someone who engaged with advanced content. Map 3-5 script variants to your main audience segments and content themes.
5. **Track, optimize, and A/B test scripts** — Log every DM conversation and track: response rate (how many people reply to message 1), qualification rate (how many meet your criteria), and conversion rate (how many take the desired action). A/B test different qualifying questions, message lengths, and CTAs to find the highest-converting script.

## Key Metrics

- **DM Response Rate** — The percentage of people who reply to your first message; for inbound-triggered DMs, 40-60% is typical; below 25% indicates your first message needs work or the trigger isn't warm enough
- **Qualification-to-Conversion Rate** — The percentage of qualified leads who take the desired action (purchase, book a call, sign up); this measures script effectiveness at moving people from interest to action
- **Revenue per DM Conversation** — Total revenue generated divided by total DM conversations initiated; this is your north star metric for determining whether the channel is worth the time investment

## Best Practices

- Keep each message under 3 sentences — DMs are a casual format and walls of text get ignored; short, conversational messages that ask one question at a time mirror natural texting behavior
- Use the prospect's name and reference specific content they engaged with — "I saw you commented on the post about [topic]" personalizes the conversation and demonstrates attention
- Always provide value before asking for anything — deliver the promised resource or answer their question before pivoting to qualification; giving first establishes reciprocity

## Common Pitfalls

- Sending unsolicited DMs without a trigger — Cold DMs from brand accounts feel spammy and damage brand perception; always base DM outreach on an inbound action the prospect took
- Being too aggressive with the sales pitch — If the conversation jumps from "Hey, here's that guide" to "Buy our product" in two messages, the prospect feels ambushed; the qualification and diagnosis steps build the trust needed for the offer to feel natural
- Not having a human in the loop — Fully automated DM funnels lack the nuance to handle unexpected responses, objections, or genuine conversations; automation should handle the trigger and first message, but humans should manage qualification and closing
