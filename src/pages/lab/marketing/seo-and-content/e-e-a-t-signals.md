# E-E-A-T Signals

E-E-A-T (Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness) is Google's framework for evaluating content quality, especially for "Your Money or Your Life" (YMYL) topics like health, finance, and legal advice. While E-E-A-T isn't a direct ranking factor in the algorithmic sense, it describes the signals Google's algorithms are designed to detect and reward. Sites that demonstrably show real experience, genuine expertise, recognized authority, and clear trustworthiness consistently outrank those that don't — and the gap is widening with each core algorithm update.

## Core Concept

Google employs thousands of human quality raters who evaluate search results using E-E-A-T criteria from the Search Quality Rater Guidelines. These evaluations train Google's algorithms to identify and reward the same signals at scale. Experience means the content creator has firsthand experience with the topic. Expertise means they have the knowledge or credentials to speak authoritatively. Authoritativeness means the site or author is recognized by others as a go-to source. Trustworthiness is the foundation — the content must be accurate, honest, and safe. Your job is to make these signals explicit and visible on your pages, not assume Google will figure them out.

## Implementation

1. **Build detailed author profiles and bylines** — Every piece of content should have a named author with a linked bio page. The bio should include: relevant credentials, professional experience, published work, and social profiles. Add author schema markup to connect the bio to the content. For YMYL topics, the author should have verifiable credentials (e.g., a financial advisor writing about investing, or a developer writing about code security).
2. **Demonstrate firsthand experience** — Google's 2022 addition of "Experience" to the framework means content from practitioners outperforms content from researchers. Include personal anecdotes, original screenshots, proprietary data, and "I've tested this" language. Product reviews should demonstrate hands-on usage. How-to guides should include original photos or videos of the process.
3. **Earn and display authority signals** — Get mentioned, quoted, and linked to by other authoritative sites in your space. Pursue guest contributions to industry publications, podcast appearances, and speaking engagements that generate external authority signals. Display on your site: "As featured in [publications]," relevant awards, certifications, professional associations, and customer logos.
4. **Build trust infrastructure on your site** — Ensure your site has: a clearly accessible "About Us" page with real team information and company history, a physical business address, a privacy policy and terms of service, secure HTTPS, contact information on every page, editorial standards or fact-checking policies (if applicable), and clear sourcing for all claims and statistics.
5. **Source and cite everything** — Link to primary sources for all statistics, claims, and recommendations. Include a "Sources" or "References" section at the bottom of content. Use cite tags and link to peer-reviewed studies, government data, and recognized industry research. Google's algorithms increasingly evaluate whether content makes unsubstantiated claims or backs them up with credible references.

## Key Metrics

- **Author Coverage Rate** — The percentage of your content with named, credentialed author bylines linked to detailed bio pages; aim for 100% on all new content
- **External Authority Mentions** — The number of times your brand or team members are cited, quoted, or mentioned by authoritative third-party sites per quarter
- **Trust Page Completeness Score** — An internal audit measuring whether all trust signals are present: About page, contact info, privacy policy, author bios, source citations, HTTPS, etc.

## Best Practices

- Prioritize E-E-A-T investment on YMYL pages first — Google applies the strictest E-E-A-T standards to content about health, finances, safety, and major life decisions
- Have subject matter experts review and be credited on content even if they didn't write it — "Reviewed by Dr. Jane Smith, Board Certified Dermatologist" adds significant trust signal to a skincare article
- Update old content to add E-E-A-T signals retroactively — adding author bylines, source citations, and experience indicators to existing pages can improve rankings without rewriting the content

## Common Pitfalls

- Faking credentials or experience — Google's systems and human raters can verify claims; an author bio that claims "20 years of experience" for someone who graduated 3 years ago will be detected and penalized in ranking
- Ignoring trust signals on commercial pages — Many sites invest in E-E-A-T for blog content but leave product and pricing pages without author attribution, source links, or trust indicators; Google evaluates your whole site
- Treating E-E-A-T as a one-time checkbox — Authority and trust are earned over time through consistent publication, external recognition, and maintained accuracy; one author bio page doesn't make you an authority
