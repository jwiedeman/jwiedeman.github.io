# Nextdoor Ads

Nextdoor is a hyperlocal social network where verified residents discuss neighborhood-specific topics — contractor recommendations, local events, safety alerts, and service reviews. For local businesses, it offers an advertising environment fundamentally different from Meta or Google: the audience is geographically concentrated, contextually primed for local recommendations, and interacting in a trusted community setting. Nextdoor ads reach homeowners and residents who are actively asking for and giving local business recommendations.

## Core Concept

Nextdoor's unique value lies in its verified neighborhood structure and recommendation culture. Unlike Facebook where local business content competes with vacation photos and news articles, Nextdoor's feed is inherently local — users are there specifically to discuss neighborhood-relevant topics. When a user asks "Who is a good plumber in [neighborhood]?" and your business appears in that context, the conversion intent is dramatically higher than a cold Facebook impression. Nextdoor offers both organic tools (free Business Page, the ability to respond to recommendations) and paid advertising (Local Deals, Sponsored Posts, Neighborhood Ads) that place your business in front of verified residents within a specific radius.

## Implementation

1. Claim your free Nextdoor Business Page — complete your profile with photos, services, hours, and contact information; this is the organic foundation that paid efforts will build on
2. Engage organically first: respond to recommendation requests in your service area, offer helpful advice (without being overly promotional), and ask happy customers to recommend you on Nextdoor
3. Launch a Local Deal — a coupon-style offer that appears in the Nextdoor feed for residents in your target neighborhoods; Local Deals include a built-in tracking mechanism showing claims
4. Test Sponsored Posts for broader reach — these native-looking posts appear in the newsfeed of targeted neighborhoods and can drive awareness for grand openings, seasonal offers, or new service launches
5. Monitor and respond to the discussion your ads generate — Nextdoor ads frequently generate comment threads where residents share their experiences, which becomes social proof that amplifies or undermines your ad depending on your reputation

## Key Metrics

- **Deal claims and redemptions** — the number of residents who claim your Local Deal and the percentage who actually redeem it, representing the top and bottom of the local conversion funnel
- **Recommendation count** — the number of organic recommendations your business receives on Nextdoor, which serves as both a social proof asset and a ranking signal within the platform
- **Cost per new customer from Nextdoor** — total ad spend divided by attributed new customers, benchmarked against your other local acquisition channels (Google Local, direct mail, sponsorships)

## Best Practices

- Lead with a generous, specific local offer — "Free gutter inspection for [Neighborhood Name] residents" performs better than generic discounts because it signals local commitment
- Personalize messaging to the neighborhood level when possible; referencing the neighborhood by name in the ad copy increases relevance and trust
- Build your organic recommendation base before scaling paid spend; Nextdoor users check your business page before responding to ads, and a page with zero recommendations undermines paid credibility

## Common Pitfalls

- Using the same generic ad copy from other platforms — Nextdoor's community-first culture requires a neighborly, helpful tone rather than aggressive promotional language
- Ignoring negative comments on your ads or recommendation threads, which are highly visible and can turn a positive ad into a negative brand moment
- Targeting too broad a radius — Nextdoor's power is hyperlocal precision; a 25-mile radius defeats the purpose and dilutes the neighborhood-level trust that makes the platform effective
