# Flyers, Door Hangers & QR Tracking

Physical flyers and door hangers remain one of the most cost-effective ways to reach households in a specific geographic area. What has changed is measurability: QR codes with UTM parameters and unique landing pages turn what was once an unmeasurable awareness play into a trackable direct-response channel. A well-designed door hanger with a scannable QR code connecting to a dedicated landing page gives you the targeting precision of digital marketing with the tangibility and novelty of physical media.

## Core Concept

Physical marketing materials work because they exist in the real world — they cannot be blocked by ad blockers, they are not competing with 47 other ads in a feed, and they create a tangible interaction that digital cannot replicate. The historical limitation was measurement: you could not know if anyone actually responded. QR codes solve this by bridging the physical-digital gap. Each campaign (or each geographic zone) gets a unique QR code that routes to a specific URL with tracking parameters, making it possible to attribute website visits, leads, and sales back to individual distribution zones with the same precision as a digital campaign.

## Implementation

1. Define the distribution zone using a tool like EDDM (Every Door Direct Mail through USPS) route maps or a local distribution service — target specific neighborhoods, apartment complexes, or zip codes where your ideal customers live
2. Design the piece with a single clear CTA and a prominent QR code — the QR should be at least 1 inch square, have sufficient quiet zone around it, and link to a dedicated landing page (not your homepage)
3. Generate unique QR codes for each distribution zone using a dynamic QR code generator (QR Code Generator, Bitly, or Rebrandly) with UTM parameters: utm_source=flyer&utm_medium=print&utm_campaign=zone-A
4. Build a dedicated landing page for each campaign that matches the flyer's offer and messaging — the page should reference the physical piece ("Thanks for scanning!") and include a conversion action (coupon claim, booking, quote request)
5. Track performance by zone: measure QR scan rates, landing page conversion rates, and downstream revenue by geographic distribution area to identify which neighborhoods respond best and deserve repeat campaigns

## Key Metrics

- **QR scan rate** — the number of QR scans divided by the number of pieces distributed, representing the response rate; benchmark is 1-3% for well-designed door hangers
- **Landing page conversion rate** — the percentage of scanners who complete the desired action (claim offer, book appointment, submit form)
- **Cost per acquisition by zone** — total distribution cost for a zone divided by conversions from that zone, enabling zone-level ROI comparison

## Best Practices

- Use a single, clear offer with a deadline — "15% off your first cleaning, scan by March 31" outperforms a flyer with multiple offers and no urgency
- Print on heavier stock (14pt+ for door hangers) with professional design — cheap-looking materials communicate a cheap business and get discarded immediately
- Include a secondary response mechanism (phone number, text keyword) for people who prefer not to scan QR codes — not everyone is QR-comfortable

## Common Pitfalls

- Linking the QR code to your homepage instead of a campaign-specific landing page, which loses tracking capability and creates a disconnected user experience
- Distributing in areas that do not match your customer profile — blanket distribution wastes budget; use demographic data to select neighborhoods that match your buyer persona
- Failing to test the QR code on multiple devices before printing — a broken QR code on 10,000 door hangers is an expensive mistake with no recovery option
