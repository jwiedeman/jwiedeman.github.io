# Local Citations & Reviews

Local citations are any online mention of your business's Name, Address, and Phone number (NAP) on directories, review sites, social platforms, and data aggregators. Reviews are customer-generated ratings and feedback on platforms like Google, Yelp, Facebook, and industry-specific sites. Together, citations and reviews form the trust and authority layer that search engines and consumers use to evaluate local businesses. Inconsistent citations confuse search engines; missing reviews lose customers to competitors who have them.

## Core Concept

Citations serve two functions: they help search engines verify that your business is real and located where you say it is (improving local search ranking), and they provide additional surfaces where customers can discover you. The critical factor is consistency — if your address is "123 Main St, Suite 200" on Google but "123 Main Street #200" on Yelp, search engines lose confidence in your data accuracy, which hurts ranking. Reviews serve as the local equivalent of social proof: 87% of consumers read online reviews for local businesses, and a business with 50+ reviews and a 4.5+ star average will capture the majority of clicks in a competitive local pack. Building both systematically is a compounding advantage.

## Implementation

1. Audit your existing citations using a tool like Moz Local, BrightLocal, or Yext — identify every directory where your business is listed and flag inconsistencies in NAP data, categories, and business descriptions
2. Correct all inconsistencies to match a single "source of truth" NAP format — decide on the exact format once (abbreviations, suite numbers, phone number formatting) and enforce it everywhere
3. Submit your business to the four major data aggregators (Data Axle, Neustar Localeze, Foursquare, and Apple Maps Connect) that feed information to hundreds of smaller directories downstream
4. Build citations on the 40-50 most authoritative directories for your industry — use a checklist from Whitespark's Local Citation Finder to identify the directories that matter most for your business type
5. Implement a review generation system: send automated post-service emails with a direct link to leave a review, train frontline staff to ask for reviews at the point of highest satisfaction, and respond to every review (positive and negative) within 24-48 hours

## Key Metrics

- **NAP consistency score** — the percentage of citations where your Name, Address, and Phone number exactly match your source of truth; target 95%+
- **Review volume and velocity** — the total number of reviews and the rate of new reviews per month across all major platforms
- **Average star rating by platform** — track your rating on Google, Yelp, Facebook, and industry sites separately; each platform has different user expectations and rating distributions

## Best Practices

- Prioritize citation accuracy over volume — 30 perfectly consistent citations outperform 100 with inconsistencies that confuse search engines
- Diversify your review platforms rather than funneling all reviews to Google; Yelp, industry directories, and Facebook reviews all contribute to prominence signals
- Create a simple review response template library for common scenarios (positive review, negative experience, neutral feedback) that maintains brand voice while saving time

## Common Pitfalls

- Using a citation distribution service that blasts your information to hundreds of low-quality directories, creating cleanup headaches when you need to update information
- Ignoring negative reviews or responding defensively, which amplifies the damage and signals poor customer service to every future reader
- Letting citations go stale after a move, name change, or phone number change — outdated citations actively harm your local search performance
