# TAM / SAM / SOM Market Sizing

TAM (Total Addressable Market), SAM (Serviceable Addressable Market), and SOM (Serviceable Obtainable Market) are concentric market sizing frameworks that help marketers and executives understand the revenue opportunity at three levels of realism. TAM answers "How big is the entire market?" SAM answers "How much of that market can we actually serve with our current product and model?" SOM answers "How much can we realistically capture in the next 1-3 years?" Together, they ground strategic planning in market reality and give investors, executives, and marketing teams a shared view of the opportunity.

## Core Concept

The three tiers work as a funnel. TAM is the total global revenue opportunity if every possible customer in the category bought a solution. SAM narrows this to the segment you can actually reach — filtered by geography, product fit, pricing, and go-to-market model. SOM further narrows to what you can realistically win given your current brand awareness, sales capacity, competitive dynamics, and growth rate. The value is not in the final number (which is always an estimate) but in the assumptions and filters you apply at each layer — these force clarity about who you are selling to and why.

## Implementation

1. Calculate TAM using either top-down or bottom-up methods. Top-down: Start with an industry analyst report (Gartner, IDC, Forrester) that estimates total category revenue, then adjust for your specific category definition. Bottom-up: Count the total number of potential customers in the world who have the problem you solve, multiply by your average annual contract value (ACV). Bottom-up is more credible because it is built on your own data and assumptions.
2. Define SAM by applying realistic filters to TAM. Common filters: geographies you operate in, company sizes you can serve, industries your product fits, languages you support, price points that match your model. For example, if TAM is $50B for global CRM but you sell exclusively to mid-market companies in North America, your SAM might be $4B.
3. Calculate SOM by estimating your realistic capture rate within SAM over the next 1-3 years. Factors include: current market share, annual growth rate, sales team capacity (number of reps x quota), marketing reach (traffic, leads, conversion rates), competitive win rate, and churn. SOM is typically 1-5% of SAM for early-stage companies and 10-20% for market leaders.
4. Document every assumption explicitly. The numbers are only as useful as the assumptions behind them. Create a one-page assumptions table listing each filter, the data source, and the confidence level. This allows stakeholders to challenge specific assumptions rather than arguing about the final number.
5. Update the model semi-annually. Markets shift, you launch in new geographies, pricing changes, and competitive dynamics evolve. A market sizing model from two years ago is a historical artifact, not a planning tool. Assign ownership of the model to someone in strategy or product marketing.

## Key Metrics

- **SAM-to-TAM ratio** — reveals how much of the total opportunity your current product and go-to-market can address, typically 10-30% for focused companies, signaling whether expansion (new geographies, products, segments) is needed for long-term growth
- **SOM capture rate** — your current revenue divided by SOM, showing how much of your realistic opportunity you have already captured and how much headroom remains
- **Assumptions sensitivity index** — identifies which single assumption, if changed by 20%, most affects the final SOM number, focusing strategic debate on the variables that matter most

## Best Practices

- Use bottom-up for SOM and SAM, top-down for TAM context. Bottom-up forces you to count real customers and apply your real ACV, making the estimate grounded. Top-down gives useful context ("the analyst says this market is $50B, our bottom-up TAM is $12B — here is why we define the market more narrowly").
- Present TAM/SAM/SOM as a range, not a single number. Showing a low, mid, and high scenario based on different assumption sets is more credible than false precision. Investors and executives respect intellectual honesty more than a perfectly round $10B TAM slide.
- Tie SOM directly to your annual revenue plan. If your SOM is $200M and your revenue target is $40M, you are planning to capture 20% of your obtainable market — a specific, debatable claim that connects market sizing to go-to-market planning.

## Common Pitfalls

- Inflating TAM to impress investors with a "massive market opportunity." Savvy investors see through $100B TAM claims that include every tangentially related market. A disciplined $2B TAM with clear bottom-up logic is more compelling than a hand-wavy $50B TAM that includes market categories you will never compete in.
- Confusing TAM with SAM. Claiming "the global HR software market is $30B" as your addressable market when you sell a niche employee wellness tool to companies with 50-500 employees in North America dramatically overstates the opportunity and misallocates resources.
- Building the model once for a fundraise and never using it operationally. Market sizing should inform territory planning, segment prioritization, marketing budget allocation, and product roadmap decisions — not just live in a pitch deck.
