# Amazon Subscribe & Save

Amazon Subscribe & Save (SnS) is a program that lets customers set up automatic recurring deliveries of consumable products at a discount (typically 5-15% off). For brands selling on Amazon, SnS is one of the most powerful customer retention mechanisms available because it converts one-time buyers into recurring revenue subscribers without requiring them to leave the Amazon ecosystem. Products enrolled in SnS earn a "Subscribe & Save" badge, qualify for additional search placement, and build a predictable demand baseline that improves inventory planning.

## Core Concept

Subscribe & Save works because it eliminates the repurchase decision. Once a customer subscribes, they receive the product automatically at their chosen interval — monthly, every 2 months, every 3 months, etc. — without having to remember to reorder. This creates behavioral lock-in: even if a competitor offers a marginally better product, the friction of canceling an existing subscription and setting up a new one keeps customers in place. For brands, SnS reduces customer acquisition cost to zero for repeat orders (no ad spend needed to re-acquire a subscriber), provides predictable demand forecasting, and increases customer lifetime value by 3-5x compared to one-time purchasers.

## Implementation

1. Enroll eligible products in Subscribe & Save through Seller Central or Vendor Central — products must be FBA-fulfilled and in a consumable or replenishable category (personal care, supplements, pet food, household goods, coffee, etc.)
2. Set your SnS discount tier strategically: the standard 5% discount is available to all subscribers, and you can offer an additional 5-10% through coupon funding to incentivize enrollment — balance the discount against the lifetime value increase
3. Optimize your product listing for the SnS context: highlight the product's consumable nature, emphasize the savings, and use bullet points that reinforce the value of automatic reordering ("Never run out of...")
4. Drive SnS adoption through Sponsored Products ads that target subscribe-intent keywords ("monthly vitamins," "dog food subscription," "automatic coffee delivery") and through Subscribe & Save coupons visible on your product detail page
5. Monitor SnS subscriber metrics: subscription creation rate, churn rate, average subscription duration, and the ratio of SnS orders to one-time orders — use this data to optimize pricing, discount levels, and inventory allocation

## Key Metrics

- **SnS subscription rate** — the percentage of total orders that come through Subscribe & Save, indicating how well your product and listing are converting one-time buyers into subscribers
- **SnS churn rate** — the percentage of subscribers who cancel each month; benchmark is 10-15% monthly churn; lower churn indicates strong product-market fit for recurring use
- **Customer lifetime value (SnS vs one-time)** — compare the total revenue generated by SnS subscribers against one-time purchasers to quantify the LTV multiplier that justifies your SnS discount investment

## Best Practices

- Offer a meaningful but sustainable SnS discount — 10-15% total savings (base 5% + 5-10% coupon) is the sweet spot for driving enrollment without destroying margins
- Use the "Subscribe and Save" badge as a competitive advantage in search results; products with the badge stand out and signal convenience and value to browse-mode shoppers
- Coordinate SnS enrollment with product launch strategy: offer an aggressive introductory SnS coupon to build a subscriber base quickly, then reduce the coupon as organic SnS adoption grows

## Common Pitfalls

- Setting SnS discounts too high, which erodes margins on a recurring basis — remember that every SnS order includes the discount, so a 15% discount on every order is significant at scale
- Ignoring SnS churn analysis, which means you do not understand why subscribers are leaving (product dissatisfaction, price sensitivity, delivery interval mismatch) and cannot fix it
- Failing to maintain consistent FBA inventory, which causes SnS delivery failures that automatically cancel subscriptions — a single stockout can destroy months of subscriber base building
