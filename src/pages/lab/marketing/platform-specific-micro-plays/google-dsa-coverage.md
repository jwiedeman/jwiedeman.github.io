# Google Dynamic Search Ads

Dynamic Search Ads (DSA) are a Google Ads campaign type that automatically generates ad headlines and landing page URLs by crawling your website content and matching it to relevant search queries. Instead of manually building keyword lists, DSA lets Google's algorithm determine which searches your site is relevant for and creates ads on the fly. DSA is the most effective way to capture long-tail search queries you would never think to bid on manually, filling the gaps in your keyword coverage and ensuring you show up for every relevant search.

## Core Concept

Even the most comprehensive keyword strategy misses a significant portion of relevant searches. Google reports that 15% of daily searches are entirely new queries never searched before. DSA solves this by using your website as the keyword source — Google crawls your pages, understands your content, and matches it to user queries dynamically. When a match occurs, Google generates a headline from your page content and routes the user to the most relevant page. This is particularly valuable for large sites (e-commerce catalogs with thousands of products, content-heavy sites with hundreds of articles) where manually creating keywords and ads for every page is impractical.

## Implementation

1. Ensure your website is well-structured with clear, descriptive page titles, headings, and content — DSA uses your site content to generate ad headlines, so poorly written pages produce poorly written ads
2. Create a DSA campaign and define your dynamic ad targets: target by specific page categories (URLs containing "/shoes/"), by page content (pages about "running shoes"), or by all pages (broadest coverage, highest risk)
3. Write 3-4 description lines that work universally across your product or service range — remember that DSA auto-generates headlines from your page content, but you control the descriptions
4. Add negative dynamic ad targets to exclude pages you do not want to advertise (privacy policy, careers page, out-of-stock products, blog posts that are not conversion-oriented)
5. Mine DSA search terms weekly: the search terms report reveals the actual queries triggering your DSA ads — promote high-converting queries to your manual keyword campaigns and add irrelevant queries as negatives

## Key Metrics

- **Search term coverage expansion** — the number of unique search queries captured by DSA that are not covered by your manual keyword campaigns, representing genuine net-new reach
- **Cost per conversion by DSA vs manual campaigns** — compare DSA's CPA against your keyword-targeted campaigns to ensure the broader reach maintains acceptable efficiency
- **New keyword discovery rate** — the number of profitable search terms identified through DSA's search term reports and migrated to manual campaigns per month

## Best Practices

- Use DSA as a coverage safety net alongside manual campaigns, not as a replacement — manual campaigns give you control over high-volume, high-value keywords, while DSA catches everything else
- Create tight ad targets for your highest-priority page categories (specific product lines, key service pages) with tailored descriptions, and use a broad catch-all target for everything else
- Review search term reports weekly and aggressively add negatives — DSA's broad matching means it will match to some irrelevant queries, and ongoing refinement is essential

## Common Pitfalls

- Targeting all pages without exclusions, which means DSA might advertise your blog, your careers page, or your refund policy instead of your product pages
- Neglecting to mine search term reports for keyword insights — DSA is one of the best keyword research tools available, but only if you actively extract and act on the data
- Running DSA on a site with thin, duplicate, or poorly organized content, which produces irrelevant matches and bad ad headlines that waste budget
