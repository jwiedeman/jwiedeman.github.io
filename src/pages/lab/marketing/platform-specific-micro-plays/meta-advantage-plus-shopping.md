# Meta Advantage+ Shopping Campaigns

Advantage+ Shopping Campaigns (ASC) are Meta's AI-driven campaign type designed specifically for e-commerce advertisers. ASC consolidates audience targeting, placement selection, and creative optimization into a single automated campaign that uses machine learning to find the highest-value purchasers across Meta's entire surface area (Facebook Feed, Instagram, Reels, Stories, Messenger, Audience Network). For many e-commerce brands, ASC has become the primary campaign type, often delivering 15-30% lower CPA than manually targeted campaigns.

## Core Concept

ASC represents Meta's shift from advertiser-controlled targeting to algorithm-controlled targeting. Instead of building audiences (lookalikes, interests, custom audiences) and letting the algorithm optimize within them, ASC starts with your entire addressable market and lets the algorithm decide who to show ads to, where, and when. It uses your product catalog, your pixel data, and its own behavioral models to identify the highest-probability purchasers. The advertiser's job shifts from audience selection to creative supply — ASC needs a high volume of diverse creative assets so the algorithm can test combinations and find winners across different audience segments.

## Implementation

1. Set up your product catalog in Meta Commerce Manager with clean, complete product data — high-quality images, accurate titles, detailed descriptions, correct pricing, and proper categorization
2. Create an ASC campaign in Ads Manager — select the Sales objective, choose Advantage+ Shopping Campaign, set your daily budget, and define your optimization event (typically Purchase)
3. Upload 10-20+ creative variations spanning different formats (static images, carousel, video, UGC), different hooks, and different messaging angles — creative volume and diversity is the primary lever you control
4. Set your existing customer budget cap to 25-30% to prevent the algorithm from over-spending on retargeting existing buyers (a common ASC pitfall)
5. Let the campaign run for 7-14 days before evaluating performance — ASC needs a learning period to calibrate, and early results are not representative of steady-state performance

## Key Metrics

- **Cost per purchase (CPA)** — the primary efficiency metric; compare ASC's CPA against your manually targeted campaigns to validate the switch
- **Return on ad spend (ROAS)** — total purchase value divided by ad spend; track at both the campaign level and the creative level to identify top-performing assets
- **New customer percentage** — monitor the share of purchases coming from new versus existing customers; adjust the existing customer cap if the algorithm is over-indexing on retargeting

## Best Practices

- Feed the algorithm with creative diversity — 5 ads is not enough; 20+ creative assets with varied formats, hooks, and messaging angles give the algorithm room to find the best combination for each audience segment
- Use the existing customer budget cap aggressively (start at 20-25%) and adjust based on your new customer acquisition goals
- Run ASC alongside (not instead of) 1-2 manual campaigns for specific audiences or promotions that need precise control; ASC is your workhorse, not your only tool

## Common Pitfalls

- Launching ASC with too few creative assets, which starves the algorithm of variation and produces results no better than manual campaigns
- Not setting the existing customer budget cap, allowing the algorithm to spend the majority of budget retargeting people who would have purchased anyway — this inflates ROAS while destroying incrementality
- Judging ASC performance during the learning phase (first 7 days) and killing the campaign before it stabilizes, which wastes the investment in learning data
