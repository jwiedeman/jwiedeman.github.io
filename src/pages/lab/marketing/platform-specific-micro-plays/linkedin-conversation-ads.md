# LinkedIn Conversation Ads

LinkedIn Conversation Ads are a messaging-based ad format delivered to a user's LinkedIn inbox that presents interactive, choose-your-own-path content. Unlike static InMail (a single message with one CTA), Conversation Ads offer multiple response buttons that branch into different message paths based on the recipient's selections. This creates a guided, self-qualifying experience where prospects choose the content most relevant to them, resulting in 4-5x higher engagement rates than traditional Sponsored InMail.

## Core Concept

Conversation Ads combine the targeting precision of LinkedIn (job title, company size, industry, seniority) with the engagement mechanics of conversational marketing. The recipient opens a message in their LinkedIn inbox that looks like a personal message from a real person at your company, with 2-3 response options like "Tell me more," "I'm interested in pricing," or "Not the right time." Each button leads to a different message branch, creating a tree of personalized pathways. This format works because it gives the prospect agency (they choose their path), it provides immediate value (each branch addresses their specific interest), and it operates in a high-trust environment (LinkedIn inbox, not a noisy feed).

## Implementation

1. Define 2-3 distinct audience needs your Conversation Ad should address — for example, "wants to see a demo," "wants to read a case study," and "wants to understand pricing" — each becomes a branch in your conversation tree
2. Write the opening message as if it were a personal outreach from a real team member (ideally a recognizable name, like a VP of Sales or a subject matter expert) — conversational tone, short paragraphs, and a clear reason for reaching out
3. Design 2-3 CTA buttons per message that represent distinct next steps — avoid overwhelming with options; each button should lead to a clearly different path or resource
4. Build each branch to deliver value and include a conversion action: branch 1 leads to a demo booking page, branch 2 opens a case study PDF, branch 3 links to a pricing page — every path should end with a measurable action
5. Set up conversion tracking for each branch's destination (landing page visits, form fills, demo bookings) and use LinkedIn's built-in Conversation Ad analytics to measure open rates, click-through rates by button, and downstream conversions

## Key Metrics

- **Open rate** — the percentage of recipients who open the Conversation Ad; benchmark is 50-60%, significantly higher than email because of the LinkedIn inbox context
- **Click-through rate by button** — which response options recipients choose most frequently, revealing which topics and CTAs resonate with your target audience
- **Cost per lead by branch** — track which conversation paths generate leads most efficiently, then allocate more budget to targeting segments likely to choose the highest-converting branch

## Best Practices

- Use a real person's name and photo as the sender, not a company page — messages from individuals get 2-3x higher open rates than brand-sent messages on LinkedIn
- Keep each message short (under 500 characters) and conversational; this is a chat-like experience, not a long-form email
- Test different conversation structures: "choose your interest" (self-qualification), "answer a question" (engagement-first), and "pick your resource" (value-first) to find what works for your audience

## Common Pitfalls

- Writing Conversation Ads like formal marketing emails instead of casual, personalized messages — the inbox context demands a conversational, human tone
- Creating too many branches (more than 3 deep) which makes the experience feel like a phone tree rather than a conversation
- Targeting too broadly on LinkedIn, which drives up costs without improving lead quality — Conversation Ads work best with precise job title, company size, and industry targeting
