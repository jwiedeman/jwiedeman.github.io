# Category Design & Reframe

Category design is the deliberate act of creating a new market category or fundamentally reframing an existing one so that your company is seen as the defining player. Instead of competing on features within someone else's category (e.g., "better CRM"), you engineer a new frame where your unique strengths are the criteria that matter (e.g., "revenue intelligence platform"). Companies that successfully design categories capture 76% of the total market capitalization in their space, according to research from the Play Bigger consultancy.

## Core Concept

The core mechanism is cognitive framing. Buyers evaluate products relative to the category they place them in. If you are slotted into an existing category, you inherit that category's evaluation criteria — criteria likely set by the incumbent. Category design shifts the frame so buyers adopt new criteria where your product naturally wins. This requires three synchronized elements: a company story (why the world has changed), a product story (what the new solution looks like), and a category story (why this new category must exist now).

## Implementation

1. Identify the "stuck moment" — the systemic problem in the existing category that incumbents cannot solve because their business model depends on the status quo. Document this with data, customer quotes, and market trends. This is your lightning rod.
2. Name the new category. The best category names are 2-3 words, describe the outcome rather than the technology, and are not easily co-opted by competitors. Test candidate names with 20+ prospects for comprehension and resonance. Avoid jargon that requires explanation.
3. Write a category blueprint — a 2-page document that defines the problem, names the category, explains why now, describes the ideal solution characteristics (without naming your product), and lists the ecosystem players needed. This becomes your internal and external reference.
4. Execute a "lightning strike" — a coordinated launch across earned media, analyst briefings, owned content (category manifesto, report, or book), a signature event, and product announcements. The goal is to flood the information environment over 4-6 weeks so that prospects, analysts, and journalists all encounter the new frame simultaneously.
5. Sustain category evangelism by publishing ongoing research, hosting community events, and getting third-party validation (analyst reports, media coverage, customer case studies) that reinforces the new category. Over 12-18 months, the category should appear in analyst quadrants, job titles, and conference tracks.

## Key Metrics

- **Category search volume** — tracks whether people are Googling the new category name over time, indicating market adoption of the frame
- **Share of category narrative** — percentage of analyst reports, media articles, and conference mentions where your company is cited as the category leader or definer
- **Inbound lead quality shift** — measures whether prospects are self-identifying the problem using your category language versus old category language, signaling frame adoption

## Best Practices

- Time your category launch to a genuine market inflection — a regulatory change, technology shift, or generational behavior change. Categories without a credible "why now" feel like manufactured marketing.
- Invite competitors into the category rather than gatekeeping it. A category with only one company is not a category — it is a product pitch. When 2-3 competitors adopt your frame, analysts and buyers take the category seriously, and you benefit as the definer.
- Align your entire go-to-market around the category: sales decks should open with the category problem, job postings should use the category name, and your website should educate visitors on the category before pitching the product.

## Common Pitfalls

- Naming a category that only insiders understand. If a prospect cannot explain the category to their boss in one sentence, adoption will stall. "Conversational intelligence" works; "asynchronous collaborative decision orchestration" does not.
- Launching the category before the product can credibly deliver on its promise. A premature category launch creates expectations your product cannot meet, and early reviewers will define the narrative negatively.
- Treating category design as a one-time PR stunt instead of a multi-year strategy. The companies that capture category economics (Salesforce with CRM, HubSpot with inbound marketing) invested years of content, events, and ecosystem-building to entrench the frame.
