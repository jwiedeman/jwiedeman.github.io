# North Star Metric

A North Star Metric (NSM) is the single measurement that best captures the core value your product delivers to customers. It serves as a company-wide alignment tool, ensuring that every team — from engineering to marketing to customer success — is pulling toward the same growth outcome. When chosen well, an NSM simplifies decision-making, reduces vanity metric chasing, and focuses resources on activities that genuinely move the business forward.

## Core Concept

The North Star Metric works because it sits at the intersection of customer value and business value. Unlike revenue alone, which is a lagging indicator, a well-chosen NSM is a leading indicator that predicts long-term revenue growth. For example, Airbnb uses "nights booked" because it reflects both host supply health and guest demand — the two forces that drive their marketplace flywheel. The metric must be something your team can influence through product and marketing decisions, not an abstract financial outcome.

## Implementation

1. List every action a customer takes that signals they received genuine value from your product (e.g., completing a project, inviting a teammate, making a repeat purchase).
2. Map each value-signal to available data — eliminate any metric you cannot reliably measure on a weekly cadence.
3. Run correlation analysis between candidate metrics and 90-day retention or 12-month revenue per cohort. The metric with the strongest predictive relationship is your top candidate.
4. Pressure-test the finalist by asking: Can a team game this metric without actually improving the customer experience? If yes, refine or add a guardrail metric (e.g., pairing "messages sent" with "messages that received a reply").
5. Publish the NSM on a live dashboard visible to the entire company, set a quarterly target, and decompose it into input levers each team owns (acquisition, activation, engagement frequency, monetization).

## Key Metrics

- **NSM growth rate (week-over-week)** — measures whether the core value-delivery engine is accelerating or stalling
- **Input lever contribution** — measures how much each sub-metric (new users, activation rate, frequency) contributed to NSM movement in a given period
- **NSM-to-revenue correlation coefficient** — validates that your chosen metric actually predicts business outcomes over rolling 6-month windows

## Best Practices

- Revisit your NSM annually or whenever your business model fundamentally changes (e.g., shifting from transactional to subscription). A stale NSM misaligns the company.
- Always pair the NSM with 2-3 guardrail metrics that prevent gaming. Spotify might pair "time spent listening" with "diverse artist discovery" to avoid optimizing for autoplay loops of one song.
- Decompose the NSM into a metric tree so each team has a clear sub-metric they own. Marketing might own "qualified signups," product might own "activation rate," and growth might own "weekly active usage."

## Common Pitfalls

- Choosing revenue as the NSM. Revenue is a lagging output, not a leading indicator. By the time revenue drops, the underlying problem has been compounding for months. Pick the upstream behavior that drives revenue.
- Selecting a metric that only one team can influence. If only engineering can move the number, marketing and sales disengage. The NSM should have input levers across multiple functions.
- Changing the NSM every quarter because growth stalled. A plateau usually means you need to improve the inputs, not swap the metric. Frequent changes destroy organizational trust in the measurement system.
