# ASO Metadata & Tests

App Store Optimization (ASO) is the process of optimizing your app's title, subtitle, description, keywords, screenshots, and icon to increase visibility in app store search results and improve conversion from store listing views to installs. ASO is to the App Store and Google Play what SEO is to Google Search — the difference is that app store algorithms are simpler, competition is often lower, and small changes to metadata can produce dramatic ranking improvements within days rather than months.

## Core Concept

App discovery happens primarily through search — over 65% of app installs on both iOS and Android come from app store search results. Your app's ranking for relevant keywords determines how many people see your listing, and your listing's creative assets (icon, screenshots, title) determine what percentage of viewers install. ASO works on both levers simultaneously: keyword optimization improves visibility (impressions), while creative optimization improves conversion rate (installs per impression). The compound effect of improving both is multiplicative, not additive.

## Implementation

1. Conduct keyword research using ASO tools (App Radar, Sensor Tower, AppTweak, or AppFollow) to identify high-volume, low-difficulty keywords relevant to your app — prioritize keywords with search volume above 20 (on a tool's relative scale) and difficulty below 50, focusing on specific use-case terms rather than generic category terms.
2. Optimize your app title (30 characters on iOS, 50 on Google Play) to include your brand name and your single highest-volume keyword — "Calm - Sleep & Meditation" is the template: brand name, then the top keyword phrase. Place secondary keywords in the subtitle (iOS) or short description (Google Play).
3. For iOS, fill all 100 characters of the keyword field with comma-separated terms (no spaces after commas, no duplicates of words already in the title/subtitle) — prioritize single words over phrases since Apple indexes all word combinations. For Google Play, write a natural-language long description that incorporates target keywords 3-5 times each across 4,000 characters.
4. Design screenshot sequences that tell a story: the first two screenshots (visible without tapping) must communicate your app's core value proposition with bold text overlays and product UI; subsequent screenshots should highlight key features, social proof ("10M+ downloads"), and a clear call to action on the final screenshot.
5. Run A/B tests using Apple's Product Page Optimization (up to 3 treatment variants) or Google Play's Store Listing Experiments — test one element at a time (icon, first screenshot, screenshot order, subtitle), run each test for 7-14 days with statistical significance, and implement winners before testing the next element.

## Key Metrics

- **Keyword Rankings** — your app's position in search results for target keywords, tracked weekly; moving from position 15 to position 5 for a medium-volume keyword can increase impressions by 500-1000%
- **Conversion Rate (Impressions to Installs)** — the percentage of people who view your listing and install (benchmark: 25-35% for iOS, 20-30% for Google Play), which is the metric most directly improved by screenshot and icon optimization
- **Organic Install Velocity** — the number of organic installs per day, which is both a result of ASO improvements and a signal that feeds back into rankings (higher install velocity improves keyword rankings, creating a virtuous cycle)

## Best Practices

- Update your keywords every 4-6 weeks based on seasonal trends, competitor movements, and new keyword opportunities — ASO is not a set-and-forget optimization; the keyword landscape shifts constantly
- Design screenshots for the small thumbnail view (what users see in search results), not the full-screen view — text on screenshots must be readable at thumbnail size, meaning large fonts and short phrases, not paragraphs
- Localize your metadata for every market where you have significant users — translating and localizing your title, keywords, and screenshots for top markets (Spanish, Portuguese, German, Japanese) can increase installs in those markets by 30-80%

## Common Pitfalls

- Stuffing the title with keywords at the expense of readability and brand identity — "Best Free Meditation Sleep Calm Relaxation App" ranks for nothing because it looks spammy and the store algorithms penalize keyword stuffing
- Running A/B tests with too many changes simultaneously (new icon AND new screenshots AND new title), which makes it impossible to attribute the result to any single change — test one variable at a time
- Ignoring the impact of ratings and reviews on ASO — apps with ratings below 4.0 experience significantly lower conversion rates regardless of how well-optimized their metadata is; fix your rating before investing heavily in other ASO elements
