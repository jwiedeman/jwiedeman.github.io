# Re-Activation Offers

Re-activation offers are targeted incentives sent to customers who were previously active but have gone dormant — typically defined as no purchase or login in 60-120 days. These offers go beyond standard win-back messaging by packaging a compelling reason to return: an exclusive discount, a free trial extension, early access to a new product, or a curated bundle. Well-executed re-activation campaigns recover 3-8% of dormant customers and generate revenue at a fraction of new customer acquisition cost.

## Core Concept

Dormant customers already know your brand, have purchase history or usage data, and required zero acquisition cost to reach. The challenge is not awareness — it is overcoming inertia. Re-activation offers work by creating a disruption in the dormant pattern: something new, something exclusive, or something too valuable to ignore. The offer must feel like a genuine gesture, not a desperate plea. The most effective re-activation offers combine a financial incentive with a product or experience update that gives the customer a new reason to engage.

## Implementation

1. **Define dormancy thresholds:** Segment your inactive audience by recency. Customers dormant 60-90 days are "at risk" and need a lighter touch. Those at 90-180 days are "lapsed" and need a stronger incentive. Beyond 180 days, you are dealing with "lost" customers who need your best offer or a fundamentally different approach.
2. **Build tiered offers by dormancy stage:** At-risk customers get a soft nudge — "Here is what you have been missing" with new product highlights and a modest 10% discount. Lapsed customers get a stronger pull — 20-25% off or a free gift. Lost customers get your best shot — a deep discount, free product, or a completely new offer they have never seen.
3. **Personalize based on purchase history:** Pull the customer's most-purchased category or last-purchased product into the offer. "We have new arrivals in [their favorite category]" with an incentive converts significantly better than a generic "come back" message.
4. **Set a clear expiration:** Every re-activation offer needs a deadline — 7 days maximum. Open-ended offers create no urgency. Include a countdown timer in the email and reference the deadline in the subject line.
5. **Measure incrementality:** Run a holdout test where 10% of the dormant segment receives no offer. Compare re-activation rates between the offer group and the holdout to determine how much revenue the offer actually generates vs. customers who would have returned anyway.

## Key Metrics

- **Re-Activation Rate** — percentage of dormant customers who make a purchase or login within 14 days of receiving the offer; benchmark is 3-8% depending on dormancy depth
- **Incremental Revenue** — revenue from the re-activation campaign minus revenue from the holdout group, minus the cost of the discount offered; this is the true ROI
- **Post-Reactivation Retention (90 days)** — percentage of re-activated customers who make a second purchase within 90 days; below 20% means you are buying one-time transactions, not recovering customers

## Best Practices

- Lead with what has changed since they left — new products, improved features, expanded selection, faster shipping. Give them a reason beyond the discount.
- Use a different sender name or email format than your standard marketing — dormant customers have been ignoring your regular emails. A plain-text email from the founder or a different subject line format can break through.
- Test physical mail (postcards) for high-LTV dormant customers — a tangible piece of mail stands out when someone has been ignoring digital channels for months
- Include a one-click re-engagement path — the CTA should take them directly to a curated page with their personalized offer applied, not to a generic homepage

## Common Pitfalls

- Sending the same discount to all dormant customers regardless of their previous spending level — a customer who used to spend $500 per order should get a different offer than someone who made one $30 purchase
- Not setting up a post-reactivation flow — if a dormant customer comes back and gets dropped into your regular email cadence with no onboarding, they will lapse again within 60 days
- Running re-activation offers too frequently — if dormant customers know you send a 25% discount every 90 days, they will wait for it. Limit re-activation offers to once or twice per year per customer.
