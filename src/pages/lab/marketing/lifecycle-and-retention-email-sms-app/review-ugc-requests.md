# Review & UGC Requests

Review and UGC request flows are automated post-purchase sequences designed to generate product reviews, photos, and videos from customers. Reviews are the single most influential factor in online purchase decisions — 93% of consumers say reviews impact their buying choices — and user-generated photos increase conversion rates by 25% when displayed on product pages. Building a systematic review collection engine turns your customer base into your most credible marketing channel.

## Core Concept

Customers rarely leave reviews unprompted. The average voluntary review rate is under 2%. But when asked at the right moment, in the right way, review submission rates jump to 5-15%. The key insight is timing: you need to ask after the customer has had enough time to use the product but before the excitement of the purchase fades. For most products, this window is 7-14 days after delivery. Pairing the ask with a small incentive (loyalty points, discount on next order) further increases response rates without compromising review authenticity.

## Implementation

1. **Trigger the request based on delivery confirmation:** Use carrier tracking data to identify when the package was delivered, then wait 7-14 days (varies by product category — skincare needs more time than a t-shirt). If you cannot access tracking data, use estimated delivery date plus a buffer.
2. **Send a simple, focused email:** The email should have one job: get the customer to click through to leave a review. Include the product image, product name, a star-rating selector in the email (Klaviyo, Yotpo, and others support this), and a clear CTA. Subject line should be direct: "How is your [Product Name]?"
3. **Make the review form frictionless:** The landing page should pre-populate the product and customer information. Offer a star rating as the minimum viable review, with optional text and photo upload. Reducing the required fields from five to two can double completion rates.
4. **Incentivize photo and video submissions:** Offer tiered rewards — 50 loyalty points for a text review, 100 points for a photo review, 200 points for a video review. Photos and videos are dramatically more valuable for conversion, so the incentive should reflect that.
5. **Follow up on non-responders once:** Send a single reminder 5-7 days after the initial request to customers who did not leave a review. Reframe the ask: "Your experience helps other shoppers decide." Do not send more than two requests total — three or more review asks generate complaints and unsubscribes.

## Key Metrics

- **Review Request Conversion Rate** — percentage of customers who receive a review request and submit a review; target 5-15% for email, 15-25% for SMS
- **Photo/Video Attachment Rate** — percentage of submitted reviews that include a photo or video; target 20-40% with a visual incentive
- **Review-Influenced Revenue** — revenue from product pages with reviews vs. pages without; products with 10+ reviews typically convert at 2-3x the rate of products with zero reviews

## Best Practices

- Use SMS for the review request if the customer opted in — SMS review requests get 3-4x higher response rates than email because they feel personal and the link is one tap away
- Syndicate reviews to Google Shopping, Amazon, and social platforms — reviews that appear across multiple surfaces multiply their impact on discovery and conversion
- Respond to every negative review publicly and constructively — a thoughtful brand response to a 1-star review increases purchase likelihood among readers significantly
- Feature UGC prominently on product pages, in email campaigns, and on social — showing customers that their content is used and valued encourages more submissions

## Common Pitfalls

- Asking for a review before the customer has received or used the product — this is the most common mistake and generates either no response or inauthentic reviews
- Requiring too much information — every additional required field (title, pros, cons, fit, age) reduces completion rate by 10-15%. Start with star rating and optional text.
- Gating reviews to only show positive ones — consumers can detect curated review sections, and a mix of ratings averaging 4.2-4.5 stars is actually more credible and converts better than a perfect 5.0
