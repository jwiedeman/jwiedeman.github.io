# Pillar Newsletter

A pillar newsletter is your brand's flagship recurring email — sent weekly, biweekly, or monthly — that delivers consistent, high-value content your audience actively looks forward to. Unlike promotional blasts or transactional flows, a pillar newsletter builds a direct relationship with your audience that is independent of algorithms. The best brand newsletters achieve 40-50% open rates and become a primary driver of both retention and organic growth through forwards.

## Core Concept

A pillar newsletter succeeds by having a clear editorial point of view and a predictable format. Readers subscribe because they know exactly what they will get and trust it will be worth their time. This means choosing a specific angle — industry insights, curated links, actionable tips, or original analysis — and delivering it with a consistent voice, format, and cadence. The newsletter becomes a product in itself, not just a vehicle for pushing promotions.

## Implementation

1. **Define your editorial angle:** Identify the intersection of what your audience needs to know and what your brand is uniquely qualified to deliver. A coffee brand might curate brewing science research. A B2B SaaS might analyze industry deals and trends. The angle should be specific enough that subscribers could describe it in one sentence.
2. **Design a repeatable template:** Create 3-5 recurring sections that appear in every issue — for example, a lead essay, three curated links, a data point of the week, and a reader question. Consistency builds habit and readers learn where to find what they care about.
3. **Set a sustainable cadence:** Weekly is ideal for engagement but demanding to produce. Biweekly is the sweet spot for most teams. Monthly newsletters struggle to build habit. Choose a cadence you can maintain for a year without burnout.
4. **Build a dedicated signup path:** Create a standalone newsletter landing page with a sample issue, clear description of what subscribers get, and social proof (subscriber count, testimonials, notable subscribers). Promote it separately from your main email list.
5. **Measure and iterate monthly:** Track open rates, click rates, reply rates, and forward rates by section. Survey subscribers quarterly on what they value most and least. Kill underperforming sections and double down on what works.

## Key Metrics

- **Consistent Open Rate** — track the trend line, not individual issues; a stable 35-50% open rate indicates product-market fit for your newsletter
- **Reply Rate** — percentage of recipients who reply to any given issue; above 1% signals genuine engagement and strong sender reputation
- **Forward/Share Rate** — percentage of recipients who forward or share via the share link; this is your organic growth engine and should be above 2%

## Best Practices

- Write the newsletter from a named person, not a brand — "From Sarah at [Brand]" gets 15-20% higher open rates than "From [Brand] Team" because people connect with people
- Include one genuinely useful insight per issue that the reader cannot easily find elsewhere — this is what earns the open next time
- Keep promotional content to 20% or less of the newsletter — one soft product mention or CTA per issue maximum. Readers tolerate promotion when it is earned by value.
- Send at the same day and time every issue — consistency trains the audience to expect and look for your email

## Common Pitfalls

- Treating the newsletter as a promotional channel disguised as content — if every "tip" points back to buying your product, readers will disengage within 3-4 issues
- Inconsistent publishing schedule — skipping weeks or changing days destroys the habit loop and signals that the newsletter is not a priority
- Trying to appeal to everyone — a newsletter for "marketers" is too broad. A newsletter for "B2B SaaS marketers scaling from $1M to $10M ARR" has a clear audience and can deliver specific value
