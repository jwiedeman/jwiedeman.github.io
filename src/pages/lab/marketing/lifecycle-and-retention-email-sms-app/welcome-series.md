# Welcome Series

A welcome series is the automated sequence of emails and/or SMS messages sent to new subscribers or first-time customers during their first 7-14 days. It consistently outperforms every other automated flow in revenue per recipient, with open rates averaging 50-60% compared to 20-25% for standard campaigns. Getting this sequence right sets the tone for the entire customer relationship.

## Core Concept

New subscribers have the highest engagement and purchase intent they will ever have. A welcome series capitalizes on this window by delivering value, building brand affinity, and guiding the subscriber toward their first (or next) purchase through a structured sequence of touchpoints. Each message should accomplish a specific job — not just repeat the same CTA.

## Implementation

1. **Email 1 (Immediate):** Deliver the promised incentive (discount code, lead magnet, free shipping), introduce the brand story in 2-3 sentences, and set expectations for email frequency. Subject line should reference the specific offer they signed up for.
2. **Email 2 (Day 2):** Share social proof — bestsellers, star ratings, customer photos, or press mentions. No hard sell. The goal is to build trust and reduce perceived purchase risk.
3. **Email 3 (Day 4):** Educate on your unique differentiator. What makes your product or service different? Use a short video, founder story, or behind-the-scenes content. Include a soft CTA.
4. **Email 4 (Day 7):** Create urgency around the welcome offer expiration. Use a countdown timer or explicit deadline. This is your strongest direct-response email in the series.
5. **Email 5 (Day 10-14):** Transition to ongoing content. Invite them to follow on social, join a community, or take a quiz. Segment based on engagement — non-openers get a different path than clickers.

## Key Metrics

- **Flow Revenue Per Recipient** — total revenue generated divided by the number of people who entered the flow; benchmark is $1.50-$4.00 for ecommerce
- **Welcome Offer Redemption Rate** — percentage of subscribers who use the welcome discount; healthy range is 8-15%
- **Series Completion Rate** — percentage who receive and open at least 3 of 5 emails; indicates deliverability and content relevance

## Best Practices

- Suppress the welcome series from subscribers who purchase before completing it — move them into a post-purchase flow instead
- A/B test incentive types (percentage off vs. dollar off vs. free shipping) at the signup level, not within the flow
- Use SMS for the urgency/expiration message (Email 4) if the subscriber opted into both channels — SMS drives 3-5x higher redemption on time-sensitive offers
- Personalize Email 2 based on the signup source (homepage popup vs. product page vs. blog) to match content to intent

## Common Pitfalls

- Sending too many emails too fast — spacing messages 2-3 days apart outperforms daily sends in both engagement and unsubscribe rates
- Using the same generic welcome flow for buyers and non-buyers — a first-time purchaser needs order confirmation and product education, not a discount they already used
- Burying the discount code in the email body — put the code in the subject line and above the fold, because 40% of welcome email opens happen on mobile lock screens
