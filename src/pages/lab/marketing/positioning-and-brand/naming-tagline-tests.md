# Naming & Tagline Tests

Choosing a brand name or tagline is one of the highest-stakes, lowest-frequency marketing decisions a company makes — and yet it is often made by committee intuition rather than evidence. Naming and tagline testing uses structured research methods to evaluate candidates against criteria that predict real-world performance: memorability, clarity, emotional tone, distinctiveness, and domain/trademark availability. Testing before committing prevents the expensive discovery that your chosen name confuses customers, infringes on a trademark, or is unpronounceable in your key markets.

## Core Concept

A great name is not the one the executive team likes most in a meeting — it is the one that performs best on three dimensions: easy to remember (recalled correctly after a single exposure), easy to understand (communicates or at least does not contradict what you do), and easy to own (distinct from competitors and available as a domain and trademark). Testing simulates real-world conditions by exposing target audience members to name/tagline candidates and measuring recall, association, and preference under controlled conditions. This removes subjective bias and replaces it with data on how the audience actually responds.

## Implementation

1. Generate 15-25 name candidates across naming strategy types: descriptive (clearly states what you do, e.g., "Salesforce"), suggestive (evokes a quality, e.g., "Slack"), abstract (arbitrary but ownable, e.g., "Hulu"), founder/origin (e.g., "Bloomberg"), and acronymic (e.g., "IBM"). For taglines, generate 10-15 options that range from descriptive ("The CRM for growing teams") to emotional ("Where work flows") to provocative ("Meetings are broken").
2. Screen candidates through a viability filter before consumer testing. Check domain availability (.com strongly preferred), trademark databases (USPTO for US, EUIPO for Europe), linguistic screening in key markets (does it mean something offensive in another language?), and competitive similarity. This typically eliminates 40-60% of candidates.
3. Run a quantitative test with 200+ target audience members. Show each candidate in a realistic context (mock ad, mock website header) for 5 seconds, then show a distractor task, then test unaided recall ("What brand names do you remember?"), aided recognition ("Which of these names did you see?"), communication ("What do you think this company does?"), emotional association ("Select 3 adjectives that describe how this name makes you feel"), and preference ranking.
4. For taglines specifically, add a "brand fit" test: show the tagline alongside 3 brand logos (yours plus 2 competitors) and ask which brand it belongs to. A tagline that could fit any brand in the category is not distinctive enough to be useful.
5. Compile results into a scorecard that weights each criterion by importance for your specific context (a B2B enterprise brand might weight clarity at 40%, while a consumer app might weight memorability at 40%). Present the top 3 candidates with data and make a final decision that balances test results with strategic judgment and legal availability.

## Key Metrics

- **Unaided recall rate** — percentage of respondents who correctly recall the name/tagline without prompting after a single brief exposure, the strongest predictor of real-world memorability
- **Communication accuracy** — percentage of respondents who correctly infer the brand's general category or purpose from the name alone, measuring whether the name helps or hurts first-impression comprehension
- **Emotional fit score** — alignment between the adjectives respondents associate with the name and the adjectives that define your target brand personality, measured as overlap percentage

## Best Practices

- Test names in context, not in isolation. Showing a name on a blank screen is not how anyone encounters it in real life. Place the name in a mock social ad, a website header, or a product screenshot. Context dramatically affects how names are perceived and remembered.
- Include a "none of these" baseline. Show respondents a set of names that includes one existing brand they should recognize. If they cannot recall the known brand, the test methodology has a problem. If they can recall it but recall none of your candidates, your candidates are weak.
- Test with both target customers and non-customers. Customers tell you about clarity and fit; non-customers (in your broader category) tell you about distinctiveness and memorability without existing brand bias.

## Common Pitfalls

- Falling in love with a name before testing it. Emotional attachment to a name chosen in a brainstorm session creates confirmation bias in evaluating test results. Generate multiple strong candidates and genuinely let the data guide the decision.
- Testing only within your organization. Internal employees understand your product deeply and will find meaning in names that are opaque to outsiders. Every name test must include external respondents who have no prior context about your company.
- Optimizing for cleverness over clarity. A witty, abstract name can work brilliantly for a consumer brand with massive media budgets (Google, Uber), but most companies cannot afford to teach the market what their name means. If your marketing budget is under $5M/year, lean toward names that communicate.
