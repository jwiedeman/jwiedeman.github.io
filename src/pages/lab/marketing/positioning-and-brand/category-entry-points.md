# Category Entry Points

Category Entry Points (CEPs) are the cues, situations, and mental triggers that cause a buyer to think of a product category. When a team leader thinks "we are missing deadlines," that is a category entry point for project management software. When a homeowner notices a water stain on the ceiling, that is a CEP for roofing services. Understanding and mapping your CEPs is critical because brands that are mentally linked to more entry points get considered more often — and consideration is the prerequisite to purchase. This concept, popularized by the Ehrenberg-Bass Institute, shifts brand strategy from "be liked" to "be thought of."

## Core Concept

Buyers do not wake up thinking about your brand. They wake up with problems, situations, and needs — and their brain retrieves whichever brands are mentally associated with those situations. CEPs are the doors through which buyers enter your category. A brand linked to 8 category entry points will be retrieved in buying situations roughly twice as often as a brand linked to 4. The strategic implication is that brand building should focus on creating and strengthening mental links between your brand and the widest possible set of relevant buying situations — not just hammering one message.

## Implementation

1. List every situation, need, occasion, motivation, and location that could trigger someone to think about your product category. For a meal delivery service, CEPs might include: "too tired to cook," "want to eat healthy but have no time," "hosting friends last-minute," "ran out of groceries," "trying a new diet," "just moved to a new city," "partner is traveling and I am alone." Aim for 15-25 CEPs.
2. Survey 200+ category buyers to measure two things for each CEP: (a) how frequently they experience this situation, and (b) which brands they associate with that situation. Use unaided recall first ("When you want to eat healthy but have no time, which brands come to mind?"), then aided recognition.
3. Map the results on a CEP landscape — a matrix with CEP frequency on one axis and your brand's linkage strength on the other. This reveals four quadrants: high-frequency CEPs where you are strong (protect), high-frequency CEPs where you are weak (growth opportunities), low-frequency CEPs where you are strong (niche advantages), and low-frequency CEPs where you are weak (deprioritize).
4. Prioritize 3-5 high-frequency CEPs where your brand linkage is weak relative to competitors. These are the biggest growth opportunities because the buying situation is common but your brand is not being retrieved. Design campaigns, content, and creative that explicitly link your brand to these situations.
5. Embed CEP language into your ongoing marketing. Every ad, email, social post, and content piece should evoke a specific buying situation rather than just stating product features. Instead of "Our meal kits use fresh ingredients," say "Too tired to cook tonight? Dinner is ready in 15 minutes." The situation cue builds the mental link.

## Key Metrics

- **Mental market share per CEP** — percentage of target buyers who name your brand (unaided) when prompted with each category entry point, tracked annually to measure linkage growth
- **CEP breadth** — number of category entry points where your brand achieves above-threshold recall (e.g., named by 10%+ of respondents), compared to competitors
- **CEP-to-consideration correlation** — the relationship between how many CEPs a buyer links to your brand and their likelihood of including you in a consideration set, validating that broader linkage drives business results

## Best Practices

- Use CEP language in your advertising creative. Show the situation, not just the solution. Ads that depict the buying trigger ("You just realized you have nothing for dinner") before showing the product create stronger mental links than ads that lead with features.
- Measure CEPs separately from brand health metrics like awareness or NPS. A brand can have high awareness and low CEP linkage, meaning people know you exist but do not think of you when they need you. CEP measurement tells you whether your brand is mentally available at the moment of need.
- Refresh your CEP map annually. New entry points emerge as customer behavior shifts (remote work created new CEPs for collaboration tools that did not exist pre-2020), and old ones fade. Keep the map current.

## Common Pitfalls

- Focusing all marketing on one CEP. This builds a strong but narrow mental association. When the buyer experiences a different situation, they think of a competitor with broader linkage. Diversify across 5-8 high-frequency CEPs to maximize mental availability.
- Confusing CEPs with target audience definitions. "Marketing managers at mid-size companies" is a target segment, not a CEP. "I need to prove ROI to my boss by Friday" is a CEP. Entry points are situations and needs, not demographics.
- Assuming your internal view of buying triggers matches reality. Run the survey. Companies are frequently surprised to discover that the CEP they spend the most budget on is not the most frequent trigger, while a high-frequency trigger they have never addressed is driving competitor consideration.
