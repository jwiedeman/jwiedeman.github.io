# Survey-Based Brand Lift

Survey-based brand lift studies measure the impact of advertising on brand perception by surveying both an exposed group (people who saw your ads) and a control group (people who did not), then comparing their responses on metrics like brand awareness, ad recall, favorability, and purchase intent. It is the primary method for quantifying the upper-funnel impact of campaigns that do not produce immediate clicks or conversions — brand campaigns, video campaigns, and awareness plays that influence consideration over time.

## Core Concept

Most marketing measurement focuses on lower-funnel actions (clicks, conversions, purchases), but the majority of advertising's value lies in shaping perceptions that influence future behavior. A prospect who has never heard of your brand converts at a very different rate than one who recalls seeing your ad and has a positive impression. Survey-based lift bridges this measurement gap by directly asking people whether they remember your brand, what they think about it, and whether they would consider purchasing. The lift — the difference between exposed and control responses — isolates the ad's causal impact on these perceptual metrics.

## Implementation

1. Define the brand metrics you want to measure: aided/unaided awareness, ad recall, brand favorability, message association, purchase consideration, and purchase intent are the standard set — choose 3-5 that align with your campaign objectives
2. Work with the ad platform (Meta Brand Lift, Google Brand Lift, YouTube BrandConnect) or a third-party research firm (Kantar, Dynata, Lucid) to set up the control/exposed methodology
3. Design survey questions that are specific and comparable across waves: "Which of the following brands have you heard of in [category]?" (unaided awareness with a list) and "How likely are you to consider [Brand] for your next [purchase]?" (purchase consideration on a 1-5 scale)
4. Run the survey during or immediately after the campaign flight — brand lift effects decay quickly, so surveying weeks after the campaign ends will understate the true impact
5. Analyze lift by audience segment, creative variant, and frequency band to understand not just whether the campaign worked but which executions and targeting strategies drove the strongest perception shift

## Key Metrics

- **Absolute brand lift** — the percentage-point difference in a metric between exposed and control groups (e.g., 38% aided awareness in exposed vs 25% in control = 13 points absolute lift)
- **Relative brand lift** — the percentage increase relative to the control baseline (13 points / 25% baseline = 52% relative lift), which normalizes for different starting points
- **Cost per lifted user** — total spend divided by the number of people whose brand perception changed, providing a cost-efficiency metric for upper-funnel campaigns

## Best Practices

- Run brand lift on campaigns with broad reach and sufficient frequency — studies on narrow audiences with low frequency will not generate enough survey responses for statistical significance
- Compare brand lift results across campaigns and over time to build benchmark data that tells you what "good" lift looks like for your category
- Use brand lift insights to optimize creative — if ad recall is strong but favorability is flat, the creative is memorable but not persuasive, which is a specific actionable insight

## Common Pitfalls

- Surveying too few people or running the study for too short a period, resulting in confidence intervals so wide that the results are inconclusive
- Asking leading questions that inflate lift numbers: "After seeing this ad for [Brand], how do you feel about them?" primes the response
- Ignoring the gap between stated intent and actual behavior — high purchase intent lift does not guarantee conversion lift, and the two should be measured separately
