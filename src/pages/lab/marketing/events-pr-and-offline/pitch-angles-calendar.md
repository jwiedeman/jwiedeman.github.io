# Pitch Angles Calendar

A pitch angles calendar is a 12-month editorial plan that maps your brand's media pitch opportunities to seasonal events, industry milestones, cultural moments, and predictable news cycles. Rather than scrambling to generate PR ideas reactively, a pitch calendar ensures you always have a relevant story ready when journalists are looking for sources. Brands with structured pitch calendars secure 3-5x more media placements than those pitching ad hoc, because they align their stories with the cadence reporters already follow.

## Core Concept

Journalists plan coverage weeks or months in advance around predictable themes — tax season in March, back-to-school in August, holiday shopping in November, year-end roundups in December. Every industry has its own calendar: healthcare has open enrollment, tech has product launch seasons, retail has holiday cycles. A pitch angles calendar identifies these windows and prepares story angles that position your brand as the expert source. The goal is to be proactive rather than reactive — pitching before the journalist starts their research, not after the story is already assigned.

## Implementation

1. **Map the annual editorial landscape:** List every relevant date for your industry: holidays, awareness months, industry conferences, earnings seasons, regulatory deadlines, and cultural events. Layer in your company's own milestones — product launches, funding rounds, customer wins, and company anniversaries.
2. **Generate 2-3 pitch angles per month:** For each time window, brainstorm story angles that connect your brand's expertise to the moment. January: "New Year resolutions and [your industry] trends." March: "Tax season implications for [your audience]." September: "Back-to-business priorities for [your buyer]." Each angle needs a specific thesis, not just a topic.
3. **Build your source and data assets:** For each pitch angle, identify what the journalist would need from you — an expert spokesperson, original data or survey results, customer case studies, or trend analysis. Prepare these assets 4-6 weeks before the pitch window. Journalists on deadline need quotes and data fast.
4. **Create a pitch timeline with lead times:** Trade publications need pitches 2-3 months ahead. Monthly consumer magazines need 4-6 months. Daily news outlets and blogs need 1-2 weeks. Podcasts need 4-8 weeks. Map your outreach dates backward from publication dates.
5. **Assign ownership and track results:** Assign each pitch angle to a team member with a clear deadline for pitch draft, media list, and outreach. Track pitches sent, responses received, interviews completed, and placements secured in a shared dashboard. Review quarterly to identify which angle types generate the most coverage.

## Key Metrics

- **Pitches-to-Placements Ratio** — number of media placements secured divided by pitches sent; a well-targeted calendar-based approach should yield 10-20%, compared to 1-3% for untargeted spray pitching
- **Coverage Consistency** — number of months per year with at least one earned media placement; the calendar should eliminate coverage gaps and maintain year-round visibility
- **Share of Voice** — your brand's media mentions as a percentage of total category mentions; track monthly to measure whether the calendar is building sustained presence

## Best Practices

- Build relationships with journalists before you need them — comment on their articles, share their work, and offer background expertise with no story attached. When you pitch a calendar angle, they already know your name.
- Create a "rapid response" section in your calendar for predictable but unscheduled events — earnings surprises, industry acquisitions, regulatory changes. Have draft commentary and spokesperson availability ready for these scenarios.
- Pitch the angle, not your product — "Our CEO is available to discuss the impact of rising interest rates on small business hiring" gets coverage. "Our product helps small businesses hire better" does not.
- Coordinate the pitch calendar with your content marketing calendar — a blog post published the same week as a media placement amplifies both and creates a hub of content around the same topic

## Common Pitfalls

- Planning angles only around your own company news — journalists do not care about your product update. They care about trends, data, and expert perspectives. Lead with what their readers want to know.
- Pitching too late — if you pitch a holiday shopping angle in November, you are 2-3 months behind. Most holiday coverage is assigned in September. Respect lead times or miss the window entirely.
- Treating the calendar as static — news cycles shift, unexpected events create new opportunities, and some planned angles become irrelevant. Review and adjust the calendar monthly.
