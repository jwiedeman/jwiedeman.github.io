# Speaking Slots

Securing speaking slots at industry conferences, summits, and events positions your executives as thought leaders and puts your brand in front of a concentrated audience of potential buyers. A single well-delivered conference talk can generate more qualified pipeline than months of content marketing, because the audience self-selected by attending and the speaker earns a level of trust that no ad can replicate. Top B2B companies treat speaking opportunities as a core pipeline channel, not a vanity metric.

## Core Concept

Conference audiences arrive with a problem they want to solve — that is why they bought the ticket. A speaker who addresses that problem with genuine insight, real data, and practical frameworks earns immediate credibility. The audience walks away associating the speaker's expertise with their brand. This authority compounds: past speaking engagements make it easier to secure future ones, each talk generates content that can be repurposed, and the networking at events creates warm relationships that convert to pipeline over the following 90 days.

## Implementation

1. **Build a target event list:** Identify 15-25 conferences where your target audience attends. Prioritize by audience quality over size — a 200-person industry summit with your exact ICP in the room is more valuable than a 10,000-person mega-conference. Note CFP (call for proposals) deadlines, which are typically 3-6 months before the event.
2. **Craft compelling session proposals:** Write 3-5 talk proposals per conference, each with a specific title, clear audience takeaway, and novel angle. "How We Grew Revenue 300% Using X" outperforms "Best Practices for X." Include speaker bio, past speaking experience, and any unique data or research that makes the talk distinctive. Conference organizers want talks that will fill seats.
3. **Prepare the speaker:** Invest in the presentation. Structure the talk around 2-3 core insights with supporting data and customer stories. Practice delivery until it is polished but natural. Include one memorable framework, visual, or data point that attendees will reference afterward. The talk should teach, not pitch — one brief mention of your company is sufficient.
4. **Maximize the event window:** Announce the speaking slot on social media 2-4 weeks before the event. Have your sales team book meetings with target accounts attending the same conference. At the event, collect contact information from attendees who approach the speaker. Live-tweet key points from the talk to extend reach.
5. **Repurpose relentlessly:** Record the talk and publish it on YouTube and your website. Turn the key insights into a blog post, a LinkedIn article series, a webinar replay, and social media clips. Send the recording to prospects who could not attend. One 30-minute talk should generate 4-6 weeks of content.

## Key Metrics

- **Post-Event Pipeline** — dollar value of qualified pipeline generated from contacts met at or influenced by the speaking engagement within 90 days
- **Audience Engagement Score** — number of attendees who approached the speaker after the talk, connected on LinkedIn, or visited your booth; indicates talk resonance
- **Content Repurpose ROI** — total engagement (views, downloads, shares) generated from repurposed talk content; a good talk generates 10-50x more reach through content than the live audience

## Best Practices

- Submit to CFPs early and with multiple proposals — conferences fill their agenda from early submissions, and offering three options gives the organizer flexibility to fit you into their program
- Build relationships with conference organizers between events — attend their events as a participant, offer to moderate panels, or volunteer as a reviewer. Organizers prioritize speakers they know and trust.
- End the talk with a specific, useful takeaway (framework, checklist, or tool) and offer to share it via email — this creates a natural opt-in that captures leads without a sales pitch
- Send a personalized follow-up to every meaningful contact within 48 hours of the event — reference the specific conversation, not a generic "nice to meet you at [Event]"

## Common Pitfalls

- Delivering a thinly disguised sales pitch — audiences detect this within 2 minutes, disengage, and the opportunity for credibility is lost. The talk must provide standalone value with no purchase required.
- Choosing events based on prestige rather than audience fit — speaking at a famous conference to an audience that will never buy from you generates vanity metrics, not pipeline
- Not following up after the event — the speaking slot opens doors, but the pipeline is built in the follow-up. Without a systematic post-event outreach plan, most opportunities evaporate within a week.
