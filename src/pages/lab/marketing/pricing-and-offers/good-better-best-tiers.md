# Good-Better-Best Tiers

Good-Better-Best (GBB) is a three-tier pricing architecture where customers choose between a basic option (Good), a mid-tier option (Better), and a premium option (Best). It is the most common pricing structure in SaaS, telecommunications, streaming services, and professional services because it balances simplicity with revenue optimization. Three tiers offer enough choice to capture different willingness-to-pay levels without overwhelming the buyer with complexity. Research consistently shows that the majority of customers (50-70%) select the middle tier, making it the key revenue lever.

## Core Concept

Three tiers work because of the "Goldilocks effect" — when faced with three options, people tend to avoid extremes and choose the middle. The Good tier serves as a low-friction entry point that captures price-sensitive customers and competitors' prospects. The Better tier is your revenue engine — designed for your ideal customer with the best balance of features and price. The Best tier serves two purposes: it captures high-willingness-to-pay customers and it anchors the Better tier, making it feel like a bargain by comparison. Every tier should feel like a natural fit for a specific customer profile, not like an arbitrary carving of features.

## Implementation

1. Define three distinct customer personas that map to each tier. Good: early-stage, individual users, or budget-conscious buyers who need core functionality. Better: growing teams or businesses who need collaboration, analytics, and integrations. Best: large teams or enterprises that need advanced security, customization, and dedicated support. If you cannot identify three genuinely different personas, you may not need three tiers.
2. Price the tiers using the 1x-2.5x-5x rule as a starting point. If the Good tier is $19/month, Better might be $49/month (2.5x), and Best might be $99/month (5x). The gap between Good and Better should be large enough that Better feels like a meaningful upgrade, and the gap between Better and Best should be large enough that Best feels premium. Test and adjust based on conversion data.
3. Assign features using the "reason to upgrade" framework. Each tier should have 1-2 clear, named reasons to upgrade from the tier below. Good to Better: "Team collaboration + advanced analytics." Better to Best: "Custom integrations + dedicated account manager." Avoid listing 20 features per tier — customers cannot process that many differences. Highlight the 2-3 that matter most.
4. Design the pricing page to guide attention toward the Better tier. Use a visual highlight (colored border, "Most Popular" badge, slightly larger card), place it in the center position, and make its CTA button the most prominent. Research shows that visual emphasis on the middle tier increases its selection by 15-25%.
5. Offer annual billing at a discount (typically 15-20% savings displayed as "2 months free") to increase commitment, reduce churn, and improve cash flow. Display both monthly and annual prices on the pricing page with the annual option pre-selected or prominently featured.

## Key Metrics

- **Tier distribution** — percentage of new customers on each tier, with a healthy distribution typically being 20-30% Good, 50-60% Better, 15-25% Best. If Good dominates, the Better tier's value proposition or pricing may need adjustment.
- **Revenue per new customer** — blended average revenue across all tiers, used to forecast and to measure the impact of pricing page changes
- **Upgrade rate between tiers** — percentage of Good customers who upgrade to Better (and Better to Best) within 6-12 months, indicating whether the tier structure creates a natural growth path

## Best Practices

- Name the tiers with customer-centric labels, not internal ones. "Starter, Professional, Enterprise" works because customers self-identify with a stage. "Basic, Standard, Premium" is acceptable but generic. "Tier 1, Tier 2, Tier 3" is terrible because it communicates nothing about who each tier is for.
- Include a visible feature comparison table below the pricing cards. While the cards should highlight only 2-3 key differences, a detailed table below satisfies the analytical buyer who wants to compare every detail. Use checkmarks and clear labels, not ambiguous descriptions.
- Offer a "talk to sales" option for Best tier or above to capture enterprise buyers who need custom pricing, volume discounts, or procurement processes. Not every buyer fits into pre-built tiers, and forcing them to self-serve can lose deals.

## Common Pitfalls

- Making the Good tier too good. If the Good tier has enough features for 80% of your target market, you will never upsell anyone to Better. The Good tier should be genuinely useful but create natural friction points that Better resolves (limited seats, limited storage, limited integrations).
- Making the Good tier too bad. A Good tier that is barely functional drives away exactly the prospects you want to hook. The Good tier is your widest funnel — make it useful enough that customers form a habit, then let their growing needs drive the upgrade.
- Pricing the gaps too evenly. If Good is $19, Better is $39, and Best is $59, the incremental cost to jump from Better to Best is only $20 — and many customers will just go for Best, cannibalizing the revenue-optimal Better tier. The gap between Better and Best should be meaningfully larger (2x or more) to protect the middle tier's selection rate.
