# Anchoring & Decoy Pricing

Anchoring is the cognitive bias where people rely heavily on the first piece of information they see (the "anchor") when making decisions. In pricing, this means the first price a customer encounters sets the mental reference point against which all other prices are judged. Decoy pricing extends this principle by introducing a strategically inferior option that makes the target option look like a better deal by comparison. Together, these techniques shape how customers perceive value without changing the actual product or price of the option you want them to choose.

## Core Concept

The anchor effect works because human brains evaluate prices relatively, not absolutely. A $50/month plan feels expensive in isolation but feels like a bargain next to a $200/month plan. The decoy effect (also called the "asymmetric dominance effect") works by adding a third option that is clearly worse than one of the other two options, making that superior option more attractive. The classic example: a magazine offers digital-only for $59, print-only for $125, or print + digital for $125. Nobody chooses print-only (the decoy), but its presence makes print + digital (the target) look like a steal — and selection of print + digital jumps from 32% to 84% when the decoy is present.

## Implementation

1. Identify your target tier — the option you most want customers to choose based on a balance of customer value and your margin. For most businesses, this is the mid-tier plan that offers the best revenue per customer while delivering a strong experience.
2. Set the high anchor. Place a premium option above your target tier that is genuinely valuable for a subset of customers but priced to make the target tier feel reasonable by comparison. If your target tier is $49/month, a $149/month enterprise tier makes $49 feel moderate. The anchor must be a real option, not a fake one — some customers should actually buy it.
3. Design the decoy. Create an option that is close in price to the target tier but clearly inferior in value. If your target plan is $49/month with 10 features, a decoy might be $39/month with only 3 features. The small price difference with a large value gap makes the target tier an obvious choice. The decoy does not need to sell — it needs to redirect attention.
4. Present prices in descending order (highest first) to establish the anchor immediately. When the first price the customer sees is the premium tier, every subsequent price feels like a deal. Research shows that descending order increases selection of mid-tier options by 10-20% compared to ascending order.
5. Test the impact by running the pricing page with and without the decoy option. Measure conversion rate by tier, average revenue per new customer, and overall conversion rate. If the decoy is working, the target tier's selection share should increase while total conversion remains stable or increases.

## Key Metrics

- **Target tier selection rate** — percentage of customers who choose the target tier, measured with and without the decoy to quantify the decoy's impact
- **Average revenue per new customer** — should increase when the anchor and decoy successfully shift selection toward higher-value tiers
- **Pricing page conversion rate** — total percentage of pricing page visitors who purchase any tier, ensuring the decoy is not adding complexity that reduces overall conversion

## Best Practices

- Make the anchor aspirational, not absurd. A $10,000/month enterprise tier next to a $29/month starter plan does not anchor — it confuses. The anchor should be 2-4x the target tier price to feel like a natural extension of the product line.
- Use crossed-out "original" prices as anchors in promotional contexts. Showing "Was $99, now $49" establishes $99 as the reference value. This is effective for seasonal sales and promotional landing pages, but requires the original price to be genuine to avoid regulatory issues and customer trust erosion.
- Combine anchoring with social proof. Label the target tier as "Most Popular" and the anchor tier as "For Teams" to add a second decision cue that reinforces the anchor's redirecting effect. Customers follow both price signals and social signals simultaneously.

## Common Pitfalls

- Creating a decoy that customers actually prefer. If the decoy is too attractive (priced too low or with too many features), it cannibalizes the target tier instead of supporting it. The decoy must be strictly dominated by the target on a value-per-dollar basis.
- Using anchoring in contexts where customers have strong external reference prices. If your competitors' prices are well-known, your internal anchor competes with the external anchor. Anchoring works best when the customer has no prior price expectation for the category.
- Over-relying on pricing psychology without delivering real value. Anchoring and decoys influence initial purchase, but they cannot compensate for a product that does not deliver on its promise. Post-purchase satisfaction and retention depend on value, not on how cleverly the pricing was structured.
