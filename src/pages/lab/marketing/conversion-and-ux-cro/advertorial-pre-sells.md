# Advertorial Pre-Sells

Advertorial pre-sell pages are editorial-style content pages that sit between your ad and your product/landing page. Instead of sending cold traffic directly to a sales page, you route them through a story-driven article that educates, builds credibility, and creates desire before asking for the purchase. This two-step approach consistently outperforms direct-to-product funnels for cold traffic because it gives skeptical visitors a reason to care before asking them to buy.

## Core Concept

Cold traffic — people seeing your brand for the first time — has zero trust and zero context. Sending them directly to a product page asks them to make a purchase decision before they understand why they should care. An advertorial bridges this gap by delivering value first. It reads like a magazine article or blog post (not a sales page), tells a relatable story, introduces the problem, and positions your product as the natural solution. By the time the reader clicks through to the product page, they are warm, informed, and pre-sold on the concept.

## Implementation

1. Write the advertorial as a genuine editorial piece, not a thinly disguised ad — use a compelling headline that promises useful information ("How I Finally Fixed My Back Pain After 10 Years"), tell a relatable story that mirrors your customer's journey, introduce the problem with specificity, and position your product as one element of the solution.
2. Structure the page to look like a content site, not a brand page — use a clean, editorial layout with body text formatting, subheadings, pull quotes, and embedded images. Avoid your standard website navigation, brand headers, or obvious product promotions in the first 60% of the page.
3. Build credibility throughout the article with third-party references, statistics, expert quotes, and customer testimonials woven naturally into the narrative — each credibility element should support the story, not interrupt it with "BUY NOW" boxes.
4. Include a clear transition point roughly two-thirds through the article where the narrative shifts from "here is the problem and why existing solutions fail" to "here is what finally worked" — this is where your product enters the story naturally, accompanied by social proof and a CTA that links to your product page.
5. Test advertorial variations by changing the story angle (personal narrative vs. investigative journalism vs. expert interview), the headline format (curiosity-driven vs. benefit-driven vs. news-style), and the CTA placement (inline text links vs. button CTA vs. product card) — small changes in advertorial structure can produce 2-5x differences in click-through rate.

## Key Metrics

- **Advertorial Read-Through Rate** — the percentage of visitors who scroll to at least 75% of the article, which indicates whether your content is engaging enough to hold attention (benchmark: 30-50% for well-written advertorials)
- **Click-Through Rate to Product Page** — the percentage of advertorial visitors who click through to the product or landing page (benchmark: 15-35%), which measures how effectively the advertorial builds purchase intent
- **Full Funnel ROAS** — return on ad spend calculated across the entire funnel (ad to advertorial to product page to purchase), compared against direct-to-product ROAS — advertorial funnels typically deliver 1.5-3x higher ROAS for cold traffic

## Best Practices

- Write at a conversational reading level (8th-9th grade) and keep paragraphs short (2-3 sentences max) — advertorial readers are skimming, not studying, and dense academic writing kills engagement
- Use native advertising platforms (Taboola, Outbrain) or Facebook/Instagram ads that link to the advertorial rather than the product page — the ad creative should match the editorial style of the advertorial, not look like a product promotion
- Always include a "continue reading" or "learn more" CTA rather than "buy now" on the advertorial — the goal is to move them to the product page in a buying mindset, not to close the sale on the article itself

## Common Pitfalls

- Writing an advertorial that is so salesy it feels like a long-form ad rather than genuine content — if readers feel tricked into reading an advertisement disguised as an article, they leave angry and your brand takes reputation damage
- Making the advertorial too long (over 1,500 words) for the traffic source — Facebook and Instagram audiences typically have shorter attention spans and prefer 600-1,000 word advertorials, while search and native traffic can sustain longer formats
- Not including enough CTAs — a single CTA at the bottom means everyone who drops off mid-article never sees your product; include subtle inline text links throughout the article and a prominent CTA after the product introduction
