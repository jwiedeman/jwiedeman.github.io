# Unity & Identity

Unity is Robert Cialdini's seventh principle of persuasion, added in his 2016 book *Pre-Suasion*. It goes beyond liking — while liking says "this person is similar to me," unity says "this person is one of us." When people perceive shared identity — same profession, same hometown, same tribe — the influence dynamic shifts from persuasion to collaboration. Brands that successfully create a sense of "we" unlock loyalty, advocacy, and price insensitivity that transactional marketing cannot achieve.

## Core Concept

Unity operates on the principle that humans categorize the world into in-groups and out-groups, and we are dramatically more receptive to influence from our in-group. This is deeper than demographic similarity — it is about shared identity categories: "I am a founder," "I am a designer," "I am a runner." When a brand positions itself as part of the customer's identity group (not just serving it, but belonging to it), resistance to influence nearly disappears. Apple's "Think Different" did not sell computers; it defined a tribe. Harley-Davidson does not sell motorcycles; it sells membership in a brotherhood.

## Implementation

1. Identify the identity your best customers already hold — what do they call themselves? What tribe do they belong to? Mine community forums, Reddit, and customer interviews for the language they use to describe their group
2. Position your brand as a member of that identity group, not an outsider selling to it — use "we" language, share the same struggles, demonstrate insider knowledge that only a true member would have
3. Create rituals and symbols that reinforce belonging — proprietary terminology, community traditions, visual markers (think Salesforce's Trailblazer identity or HubSpot's inbound movement)
4. Build community infrastructure that lets members connect with each other, not just with your brand — Slack groups, annual events, user conferences, and ambassador programs
5. Define the out-group clearly (without being hostile) — "We are for bootstrapped founders, not VC-backed startups" clarifies who belongs and strengthens in-group identity

## Key Metrics

- **Community participation rate** — percentage of customers who actively engage in brand community spaces
- **Self-identification rate** — how often customers use your tribal language unprompted (calling themselves "Trailblazers," "HubSpotters," etc.)
- **Customer lifetime value by community engagement** — community members should show meaningfully higher LTV than non-members

## Best Practices

- Earn the right to claim unity by genuinely being part of the community — founder story, team composition, and company values must authentically align with the identity you are claiming
- Celebrate community members publicly — spotlight customers, share their wins, and position them as the heroes, not your brand
- Create shared language and inside references that make members feel like insiders — this is the social glue that turns customers into tribe members

## Common Pitfalls

- Appropriating an identity you do not genuinely belong to — audiences detect inauthenticity immediately and the backlash is severe
- Creating exclusivity that feels elitist rather than belonging-oriented; the goal is warmth and shared purpose, not gatekeeping
- Over-indexing on community building before the product delivers real value — unity without substance is just a fan club that eventually dissolves
