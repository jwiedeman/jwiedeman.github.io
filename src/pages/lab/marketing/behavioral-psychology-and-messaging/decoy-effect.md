# Decoy Effect

The decoy effect (also called asymmetric dominance) occurs when adding a third, inferior option to a choice set makes one of the original options significantly more attractive. When a medium popcorn costs $6.50 and a large costs $7.00, the medium looks like a bad deal and the large feels like a steal — even though the large was the intended target all along. This pricing psychology technique is one of the most reliable ways to shift buyer preference toward your most profitable tier.

## Core Concept

The decoy effect works because humans struggle to evaluate options in absolute terms and instead rely on relative comparisons. When two options are difficult to compare (different features, different price points), adding a third option that is clearly worse than one but comparable to the other creates an easy comparison. The brain gravitates toward the option that "wins" the comparison. The classic example is The Economist's pricing experiment: a print-only subscription for $125, a web-only for $59, and a print-plus-web for $125. Nobody chose print-only, but its presence made print-plus-web look like an incredible deal, shifting the majority of subscribers to the most expensive combined option.

## Implementation

1. Identify your target option — the plan, product, or package you want most customers to choose (usually the highest-margin mid-tier or premium option)
2. Design a decoy that is slightly worse than your target on one dimension but priced similarly — the decoy must be clearly dominated by the target option but competitive with the alternative
3. Position all three options side-by-side so the comparison is immediate and obvious; the decoy should visually sit between or near the target to facilitate direct comparison
4. Test the decoy's impact by measuring plan selection distribution with and without the decoy present — a well-designed decoy should shift 20-30% of selections toward the target
5. Iterate on the decoy's attributes — adjust price, features, and positioning until the target option captures the desired share of selections

## Key Metrics

- **Target option selection rate** — the percentage of buyers choosing your intended option, measured with and without the decoy
- **Average revenue per customer** — if the decoy is working, ARPC should increase as buyers shift to higher-value options
- **Pricing page bounce rate** — a confusing decoy setup can increase bounces; monitor to ensure the decoy simplifies rather than complicates the decision

## Best Practices

- The decoy should be obviously inferior to the target but not absurdly so — if the decoy looks like a joke, buyers feel manipulated rather than guided
- Use the decoy to make your target option the "obvious" choice; the best decoy makes customers feel smart for choosing the target, not tricked into it
- Apply the decoy effect beyond pricing — in content (offer three options where one is clearly best), in product configuration, and in upgrade prompts

## Common Pitfalls

- Creating a decoy that is actually attractive to some buyers, which cannibalizes sales from the target option instead of boosting them
- Making the pricing structure so complex that the decoy adds confusion rather than clarity — three options is ideal; four or more often overwhelms
- Using the decoy effect on a pricing page where the core value proposition is unclear; the decoy optimizes choice, but only if buyers are already committed to purchasing
