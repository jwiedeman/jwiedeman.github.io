# Consistency & Commitment

The consistency principle states that once people take a small action or make a public statement, they feel internal pressure to behave consistently with that initial commitment. In marketing, this means that getting a prospect to take one small step — answering a quiz, signing up for a free tool, saying "yes" to a minor request — dramatically increases the likelihood they will take the next, larger step. It is the psychological engine behind every effective nurture sequence.

## Core Concept

Humans have a deep need to appear consistent with their past actions and stated beliefs. When someone takes a voluntary action, their self-image shifts to accommodate it: "I am the kind of person who does X." Each subsequent request that aligns with that identity becomes easier to accept. This is why free trial users convert at higher rates than cold prospects — they have already committed the act of signing up, and purchasing becomes consistent with that identity. The effect is strongest when the initial commitment is active (not passive), public (visible to others), and voluntary (not coerced).

## Implementation

1. Design a micro-commitment ladder — map out 4-6 progressively larger asks, starting with something nearly effortless (a quiz answer, a free tool usage, a single-field email signup)
2. Make the first commitment active and identity-relevant: "Tell us your biggest marketing challenge" is more binding than "Enter your email" because it involves self-expression
3. Reference previous commitments in follow-up messaging: "Since you downloaded our SEO guide, you might be interested in..." reinforces the identity thread
4. Use progressive profiling — collect information across multiple interactions rather than one long form, building commitment incrementally
5. Add public commitment mechanisms where appropriate — community introductions, public goal-setting, shared progress milestones — which strengthen the consistency pressure

## Key Metrics

- **Step-through rate** — percentage of users who complete each successive step in the commitment ladder
- **Free-to-paid conversion rate** — the ultimate measure of whether small commitments are leading to the big one
- **Engagement depth score** — composite metric tracking how many micro-commitments a user has made before purchase

## Best Practices

- Start with commitments that deliver immediate value to the user (not just data collection for you), so the first "yes" feels rewarding rather than extractive
- Make commitment progression feel natural and logical — each step should clearly connect to the previous one and to the user's stated goals
- Use commitment language in CTAs: "Start my free audit" (identity-affirming) outperforms "Submit" (transactional) because it frames the action as self-directed

## Common Pitfalls

- Asking for too large a commitment too early, which triggers reactance instead of consistency — a credit card requirement on a "free" trial violates this principle
- Failing to reference earlier commitments in follow-up, which wastes the psychological investment the prospect already made
- Using manipulative escalation (bait-and-switch tactics) that exploits consistency without delivering proportional value at each step, destroying trust when the pattern becomes visible
