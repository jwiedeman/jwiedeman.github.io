# Temporal Reframing

Temporal reframing is the technique of expressing a price in the smallest credible time unit to reduce its perceived magnitude. "$1 a day" feels dramatically cheaper than "$365 a year," even though they are mathematically identical. This framing exploits the brain's tendency to evaluate small numbers as less significant, making otherwise intimidating price points feel trivial when expressed as daily, weekly, or per-use costs.

## Core Concept

The brain processes numbers through what researchers call "evaluability" — a number's perceived size depends on the context and scale in which it is presented. A $29/month subscription triggers more deliberation than "$0.96 per day" because the monthly figure is large enough to trigger budget evaluation, while the daily figure falls below the threshold of financial concern. Temporal reframing works best when the reframed amount maps to a familiar small expense ("less than a cup of coffee") that the prospect already spends without thinking. The technique does not change the actual cost — it changes how the cost feels.

## Implementation

1. Calculate the daily, weekly, or per-use cost of your product and test which time frame produces the lowest perceived expense without feeling absurd (per-minute pricing feels manipulative)
2. Pair the temporal reframe with a familiar comparison: "$2.50/day — less than your morning latte" is more effective than "$2.50/day" alone because the comparison normalizes the cost
3. Use temporal reframing on pricing pages, in email campaigns, and in ad copy for subscription and recurring-cost products where the annual or monthly total triggers sticker shock
4. A/B test the temporal frame against the standard price display — not every audience responds the same way, and some sophisticated buyers view daily pricing as a manipulation tactic
5. Apply temporal reframing to value communication as well: "Saves your team 2 hours every day" feels more impactful than "Saves 520 hours per year" because the daily benefit is easier to visualize

## Key Metrics

- **Conversion rate by price frame** — directly A/B test "$X/year" versus "$X/month" versus "$X/day" to identify which frame maximizes conversions
- **Price objection rate in sales calls** — track whether temporal reframing in materials reduces the frequency of price pushback during live conversations
- **Average contract value** — ensure temporal reframing is not inadvertently steering buyers toward shorter commitments; it should make annual plans feel cheaper, not encourage monthly plans

## Best Practices

- Use the daily frame for products over $200/year where the annual price triggers budget scrutiny — below that threshold, temporal reframing may be unnecessary
- Always anchor the reframed price against a trivially small comparison: the cost of a coffee, a streaming subscription, a parking meter — something the audience already spends daily without considering
- Keep temporal reframing honest: display both the reframed price and the actual billing amount so buyers feel informed, not tricked

## Common Pitfalls

- Using temporal reframing so aggressively that it feels condescending — sophisticated B2B buyers know that "$3.29/day" is $1,200/year and may resent the perceived manipulation
- Failing to show the actual billing amount alongside the reframe, which creates distrust when the real charge appears on the invoice
- Applying temporal reframing to one-time purchases where it does not make logical sense — "Just $0.27 per use!" only works if the customer can envision using the product enough times to justify the frame
