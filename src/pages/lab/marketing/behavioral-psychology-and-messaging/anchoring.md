# Anchoring

Anchoring is the cognitive bias where the first piece of information a person encounters disproportionately influences their subsequent judgments. In pricing, negotiation, and marketing, the initial number or frame becomes the reference point against which everything else is evaluated. A $299 plan looks expensive in isolation but feels like a bargain when presented next to a $999 plan. Whoever sets the anchor controls the conversation.

## Core Concept

The brain does not evaluate options in absolute terms — it evaluates them relative to a reference point. The anchor, once set, is almost impossible to ignore even when people are aware of the bias. This is why real estate agents show an overpriced house first, why SaaS companies lead with the enterprise plan, and why crossed-out "original prices" still drive sales even when consumers know the original price was inflated. Anchoring affects not just price perception but also feature expectations, timeline estimates, and value assessment.

## Implementation

1. Design your pricing page to display the highest-priced option first (left-to-right or top-to-bottom), establishing the anchor before prospects see lower-priced alternatives
2. Show the "full value" before revealing the actual price: "This package includes $4,700 worth of tools and training — yours for $497" makes the price feel like 90% off
3. Use crossed-out pricing strategically but honestly — display genuine previous prices or competitor pricing as an anchor, never fabricated numbers
4. In sales conversations, present the largest package or most comprehensive solution first, then "work down" to let the prospect feel they are getting a deal at a lower tier
5. Anchor on non-price dimensions too — lead with the biggest customer result ("Our average client sees 340% ROI") so that all subsequent claims are evaluated relative to that high point

## Key Metrics

- **Average order value (AOV) shift** — track whether changing the anchor (pricing display order, value stacking) moves the average purchase price upward
- **Plan selection distribution** — measure which pricing tiers are selected most frequently and test whether changing the anchor shifts the distribution
- **Price sensitivity score** — survey or behaviorally measure how much price resistance decreases when an appropriate anchor is set

## Best Practices

- Always present a premium option even if few people buy it — its primary job is to anchor perception and make mid-tier options feel reasonable
- Stack value by listing all included components with individual prices before revealing the bundle price; each line item reinforces the anchor
- Use round numbers for anchors and precise numbers for actual prices — "$5,000 value, yours for $1,247" because precision signals calculated fairness

## Common Pitfalls

- Setting the anchor too high relative to the actual price, which triggers disbelief rather than value perception ("$50,000 value for $29" is not credible)
- Failing to set any anchor at all, letting the prospect's budget or a competitor's price become the reference point by default
- Using anchoring dishonestly with fabricated "original" prices or inflated "value" calculations, which violates FTC guidelines and erodes trust
