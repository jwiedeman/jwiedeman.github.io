# Peak-End Rule

The peak-end rule, discovered by Daniel Kahneman, states that people judge an experience based almost entirely on two moments: the most intense point (the peak) and the final moment (the end). The overall duration and average quality matter far less than these two snapshots. For marketers, this means that a mediocre experience with one amazing moment and a strong ending will be remembered more favorably than a consistently good experience that fizzles out.

## Core Concept

The peak-end rule exists because human memory does not record experiences like a video camera — it takes snapshots. The "remembering self" evaluates past experiences by averaging the peak intensity and the ending, essentially ignoring everything in between. This is why a 3-hour flight with terrible turbulence in the middle but a smooth landing and a warm goodbye from the crew is remembered better than a perfectly fine flight with a bumpy landing. For customer experience and marketing, the strategic implication is clear: invest disproportionately in creating one unforgettable peak and an exceptional ending.

## Implementation

1. Map your customer journey and identify the current peak (best moment) and end (final interaction) — if neither is exceptional, you have a design problem
2. Engineer a deliberate "peak moment" that exceeds expectations: an unexpected gift in the package, a personalized onboarding video, a surprise upgrade, or a handwritten note — something that creates a memorable emotional spike
3. Design the ending of every interaction to leave a positive final impression: post-purchase thank-you sequences, offboarding experiences that leave the door open, and checkout confirmations that make the buyer feel great about their decision
4. Eliminate negative peaks (the worst moments) with the same intensity you use to create positive ones — a terrible support interaction can become the peak memory that defines the entire relationship
5. Apply the rule to individual touchpoints: emails should end with the strongest line, landing pages should close with the most compelling element, and sales calls should finish with a memorable value statement

## Key Metrics

- **Net Promoter Score (NPS) by journey stage** — measure whether your designed peak and ending moments correlate with higher NPS than other stages
- **Post-experience recall accuracy** — in customer interviews, ask what they remember; the peak and end should dominate unprompted recall
- **Repeat purchase rate** — customers with strong peak-end experiences should return at higher rates than those with merely adequate overall experiences

## Best Practices

- Invest more in making one moment incredible than in making every moment slightly above average — asymmetric investment in peaks yields better outcomes
- Fix negative endings before creating positive peaks; a bad ending overwrites a good peak, but a good ending can partially salvage a bad experience
- Design your offboarding (cancellation, returns, end of contract) to be gracious and helpful — customers who leave with a positive ending come back; those who leave frustrated become detractors

## Common Pitfalls

- Spreading experience investment evenly across the entire journey, producing a flat "good enough" experience that no one remembers distinctly
- Focusing exclusively on acquisition peaks (amazing first impression) while neglecting retention endings (forgettable renewal, frustrating cancellation)
- Creating a peak that is disconnected from your core value — a flashy unboxing experience means nothing if the product itself disappoints during daily use
