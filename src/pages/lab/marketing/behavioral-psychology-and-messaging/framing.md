# Framing

Framing is the principle that the way information is presented — not just the information itself — fundamentally changes how people perceive and respond to it. "95% fat-free" and "contains 5% fat" describe the same product but produce dramatically different purchase intent. In marketing, every headline, price display, and feature description is a framing decision, and the frame you choose often matters more than the facts you present.

## Core Concept

Framing works because the brain does not process information objectively — it processes information contextually. Tversky and Kahneman demonstrated this with their classic "Asian Disease Problem," where identical outcomes framed as lives saved versus lives lost produced completely opposite preferences. For marketers, this means the same product benefit can be positioned as a gain ("Increase conversions by 30%"), a loss prevention ("Stop losing 30% of potential conversions"), or a social norm ("Join 10,000 marketers who increased conversions"), and each frame will resonate differently with different audiences and at different funnel stages.

## Implementation

1. Identify your product's core benefits and write three versions of each: gain-framed ("get X"), loss-framed ("stop losing X"), and social-framed ("join others who got X") — then test all three
2. Frame pricing in the most favorable context: show monthly cost rather than annual total for low-commitment positioning, or show annual savings versus monthly for value positioning
3. Reframe features as outcomes — "256-bit encryption" means nothing to most buyers, but "Your data is protected by the same security used by major banks" frames the same feature as a meaningful benefit
4. Use comparison framing to control context: "Costs less than your daily coffee" reframes a $150/month subscription from a budget decision to a trivial expense
5. Test negative versus positive framing systematically across your email subject lines, ad headlines, and landing page headers — the optimal frame varies significantly by audience and offer type

## Key Metrics

- **Frame-specific conversion rate** — A/B test gain-framed versus loss-framed versus social-framed versions of the same page to identify which frame resonates with your audience
- **Message pull-through in sales calls** — track which frames prospects repeat back to sales reps, indicating which framing stuck and resonated
- **Click-through rate by frame type** — in email and ad testing, measure which framing approach drives the most engagement

## Best Practices

- Match the frame to the audience's emotional state: loss framing works best for risk-averse enterprise buyers, gain framing works best for aspirational early adopters
- Frame complex decisions as simple ones — "Choose between Plan A and Plan B" is more effective than presenting a comparison matrix with 47 feature rows
- Use positive framing for brand building and emotional connection; use negative framing for conversion and urgency at the bottom of the funnel

## Common Pitfalls

- Framing benefits in technical terms your audience does not understand — "99.9% uptime" means nothing to a non-technical buyer without the frame "your site will never go down during a sale"
- Using negative framing so aggressively that it creates anxiety instead of action — there is a line between motivating urgency and triggering avoidance
- Assuming one frame works for everyone; different segments, funnel stages, and emotional states require different frames, which is why testing is essential
