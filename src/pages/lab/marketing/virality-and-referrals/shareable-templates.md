# Shareable Templates

Shareable templates are pre-built, customizable assets (documents, designs, workflows, frameworks) that users personalize and distribute to their own audiences. When someone shares a Notion template, a Canva design, a Figma file, or an Airtable base, every recipient encounters the product organically. The template is both the value delivery and the marketing — each share creates a new potential user who experiences the product's value firsthand before ever visiting a marketing page.

## Core Concept

Templates are the ultimate product-led growth mechanic because they invert the traditional funnel. Instead of awareness leading to consideration leading to trial, templates deliver the trial experience first. A user receives a shared template, opens it, sees its value, and naturally wonders "what tool is this built on?" The product discovery is embedded in the value delivery. This creates a distribution flywheel: more templates shared means more users discovering the product, which means more templates created and shared.

## Implementation

1. Build a template gallery within your product featuring 20-50 high-quality, professionally designed templates across your most popular use cases — categorize them by industry (marketing, sales, engineering), use case (project management, content calendar, budget tracker), and complexity (beginner, intermediate, advanced).
2. Make every template one-click shareable with a public link that allows anyone to view the template and duplicate it into their own account — the view experience should showcase the template's value while making account creation (to duplicate) feel like a natural next step, not a barrier.
3. Enable community template creation by giving users tools to package their custom setups as templates and share them publicly — this scales your template library exponentially because users create templates for niche use cases your team would never think to build.
4. Add branded attribution to shared templates — a small "Made with [Product]" badge or watermark that links back to your signup page, ensuring that every shared template generates discovery even when shared outside your platform (screenshots, exports, embedded views).
5. Promote top templates through SEO-optimized template landing pages (e.g., "Free Marketing Calendar Template"), social media content showcasing creative template uses, and email campaigns to existing users highlighting new templates — templates are content marketing assets that rank in search and drive qualified traffic.

## Key Metrics

- **Template Share Rate** — the percentage of users who share at least one template externally (benchmark: 5-15% of active users), which indicates how shareable and valuable your templates are
- **Template-to-Signup Conversion Rate** — the percentage of template viewers who create an account to use the template (benchmark: 10-25%), which measures the effectiveness of your template-to-signup funnel
- **Template Virality Coefficient** — the average number of new users generated per shared template, calculated across all template shares, which determines the organic growth contribution of your template strategy

## Best Practices

- Design templates for specific, search-friendly use cases rather than generic ones — "Q4 Product Launch Timeline Template" will attract more qualified users than "Project Management Template" because specificity signals expertise and matches search intent
- Feature user-created templates prominently alongside official templates to build community and signal that the product is flexible enough for diverse use cases
- Include instructional context within each template (comments, example data, a "how to use this" section) so recipients can immediately see the value without needing to figure out the structure from scratch

## Common Pitfalls

- Creating templates that are too basic to be genuinely useful — a blank spreadsheet with column headers is not a template; a fully structured system with example data, formulas, automations, and documentation is a template worth sharing
- Not making templates discoverable through search engines — each template should have its own landing page with title tags, meta descriptions, and content optimized for the use case it serves
- Allowing template quality to degrade by letting anyone publish templates without curation — a gallery full of low-quality user templates undermines trust; implement a review process or rating system to surface the best ones
