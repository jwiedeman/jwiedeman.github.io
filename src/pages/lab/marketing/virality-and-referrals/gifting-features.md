# Gifting Features

Gifting features allow users to purchase or share your product as a gift for someone else, directly within your product experience. This goes beyond traditional gift cards — it means building gifting into the core product flow so that sending your product to a friend is as easy as sharing a link. Spotify's "gift a playlist," Audible's "send this book," and Apple's App Store gifting all demonstrate how reducing friction in the giving process converts your existing users into acquisition channels.

## Core Concept

Gifting works as a growth mechanic because it combines three powerful forces: the social motivation to give (people enjoy making others happy), the trust transfer of a personal recommendation (a gift from a friend carries more weight than any ad), and the elimination of the biggest acquisition barrier (price). When someone gifts your product, the recipient tries it with zero financial risk and the implicit endorsement of someone they trust. The conversion rates on gifted products are dramatically higher than any paid channel because the social proof is baked in.

## Implementation

1. Identify the most "giftable" moments and products in your business — for subscriptions, this is typically a free month or trial extension; for e-commerce, it is the bestselling or most universally appealing SKU; for SaaS, it is premium access for a limited time. The gifted item should showcase your product's core value without requiring the recipient to make any commitment.
2. Build a gifting flow that takes under 30 seconds to complete: select "Gift this" button visible on the product or subscription page, enter recipient's name and email (or generate a shareable link), add an optional personal message, and complete payment (or, for free gifting, just hit send).
3. Design the gift receipt experience to maximize activation — the recipient should receive a beautifully designed email or message that clearly communicates who sent the gift, what they are receiving, and one single button to claim it. The claim flow should require minimal steps (ideally just account creation).
4. Time gifting prompts around natural gifting occasions (holidays, birthdays) and product milestones (after a user achieves something notable, prompt "Share this experience with a friend") — proactive prompts significantly increase gifting volume compared to relying on users to discover the feature.
5. Track the full gifting funnel: gifts initiated, gifts completed (payment or send), gifts opened by recipients, gifts claimed (account created), and gifted user retention at 7/30/90 days — this reveals where the gifting experience breaks down and whether gifted users convert into retained customers.

## Key Metrics

- **Gift Completion Rate** — the percentage of users who start the gifting flow and actually send the gift (benchmark: 40-60% for well-designed flows), which indicates friction levels in your gifting UX
- **Gift-to-Activation Rate** — the percentage of received gifts that are claimed and activated by recipients (benchmark: 50-70%), which measures how compelling the gift receipt experience is
- **Gifted User LTV** — the lifetime value of users acquired through gifting compared to users acquired through other channels, which typically shows 20-40% higher retention because of the trust transfer

## Best Practices

- Offer a free gifting option alongside paid gifting — let users send a free trial, a free month, or a sample to friends at no cost; the volume of free gifts will far exceed paid gifts and the acquisition value often justifies the cost
- Make the gift receipt feel personal and special, not transactional — include the sender's name prominently, their personal message, and a warm visual design that makes the recipient feel valued rather than marketed to
- Prompt gifting after moments of delight — when a user finishes a great book, completes a workout, achieves a goal, or has a positive customer service interaction, that is the moment to surface "Share this with someone you care about"

## Common Pitfalls

- Burying the gifting feature deep in menus or account settings where users never discover it — the gift button should be visible on product pages, in the app's main navigation, and in post-purchase confirmation flows
- Treating gifted user onboarding identically to standard user onboarding — gifted users have different context (they know someone who loves the product) and should receive tailored messaging that references the gift and the gifter
- Not following up with gift recipients who do not claim their gift within 3-5 days — a gentle reminder email ("Sarah sent you a gift that's waiting for you") recovers 15-25% of unclaimed gifts
