# Tiered Account Lists

Tiered account lists segment your target accounts into three to four priority levels, each with a distinct engagement strategy and resource allocation. Tier 1 accounts receive fully personalized, high-touch campaigns. Tier 2 gets semi-personalized outreach at the industry or persona level. Tier 3 receives programmatic, one-to-many marketing. This structure prevents the most common ABM failure mode: trying to run one-to-one campaigns for hundreds of accounts and delivering mediocre experiences to all of them.

## Core Concept

Not all target accounts deserve the same investment. A $500K potential deal with a high-ICP-fit account justifies a dedicated campaign, personalized content, and executive engagement. A $50K opportunity with moderate fit does not. Tiered account lists force strategic prioritization by explicitly defining how much time, budget, and creative effort each account receives. The tier determines the playbook, not the other way around.

## Implementation

1. **Define tier criteria and sizes:** Tier 1: 10-25 accounts that represent your highest revenue potential and strongest ICP fit — these get truly one-to-one treatment. Tier 2: 50-200 accounts grouped by shared characteristics (industry, size, use case) — these get one-to-few campaigns. Tier 3: 200-1000+ accounts that meet minimum ICP thresholds — these get scaled, programmatic campaigns.
2. **Build the lists using ICP scores and deal data:** Start with ICP scores and layer in deal size potential, existing relationships, competitive displacement opportunity, and strategic value (logo value, reference-ability). Tier 1 should include accounts where you have an executive sponsor or warm introduction.
3. **Assign resource allocation per tier:** Tier 1: Dedicated SDR, personalized landing pages, custom content, executive-to-executive outreach, direct mail, and events. Tier 2: Shared SDR coverage, industry-specific content, semi-personalized ads, and persona-based email sequences. Tier 3: Automated nurture, retargeting ads, scaled webinars, and content syndication.
4. **Align sales and marketing on the lists:** Both teams must agree on which accounts sit in which tier. Hold a quarterly list review meeting where sales and marketing jointly evaluate, promote, and demote accounts. An account that shows strong engagement moves from Tier 2 to Tier 1. An account that has gone silent moves down.
5. **Track engagement and pipeline by tier:** Build dashboards that show engagement metrics, pipeline generation, and revenue by tier. This validates whether your tier assignments are accurate and whether the differentiated investment is paying off.

## Key Metrics

- **Pipeline Generation by Tier** — dollar value of pipeline created for each tier; Tier 1 should generate disproportionately more pipeline per account than Tier 3
- **Engagement Rate by Tier** — percentage of accounts in each tier showing meaningful engagement (ad clicks, website visits, content downloads, meeting requests); Tier 1 should show 60%+ engagement
- **Cost Per Opportunity by Tier** — marketing and sales cost to generate one qualified opportunity in each tier; higher costs for Tier 1 are acceptable if win rates are correspondingly higher

## Best Practices

- Keep Tier 1 small enough that each account gets genuine attention — if your team cannot name every Tier 1 account from memory, the list is too big
- Assign a named "account owner" from both sales and marketing for every Tier 1 account — shared accountability ensures coordinated outreach instead of competing messages
- Promote accounts between tiers based on engagement signals, not just firmographic fit — an account that suddenly starts researching your category deserves higher priority regardless of its original score
- Review and refresh lists quarterly — account priorities change as contracts expire, budgets shift, and competitive dynamics evolve

## Common Pitfalls

- Making Tier 1 too large — 100 "Tier 1" accounts means none of them actually receive Tier 1 treatment. If you cannot personalize a landing page for each one, it is not truly Tier 1.
- Assigning tiers based solely on deal size without considering fit — a $1M opportunity at a company that does not match your ICP will waste more resources than it generates
- Setting tiers once and never adjusting — static lists decay in value. The account that was perfect 6 months ago may have just signed a competitor's three-year contract.
