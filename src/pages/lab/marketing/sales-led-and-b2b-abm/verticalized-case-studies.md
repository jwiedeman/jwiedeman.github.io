# Verticalized Case Studies

Verticalized case studies are customer success stories tailored to specific industries, featuring metrics, workflows, and language that resonate with prospects in that vertical. A generic case study says "We helped a company increase revenue by 30%." A verticalized case study says "We helped a 200-bed regional hospital reduce patient readmission rates by 30% while cutting administrative overhead by $1.2M annually." The specificity is what drives conversion — prospects trust stories from companies that look like them.

## Core Concept

B2B buyers evaluate solutions through the lens of their own industry. A healthcare buyer wants to know you understand HIPAA requirements, EHR integrations, and value-based care models. A financial services buyer wants to see you handle compliance, multi-entity reporting, and regulatory audits. Verticalized case studies prove that your product works not just in general, but in their specific operating environment with their specific constraints. This reduces perceived implementation risk, which is the primary objection in vertical sales.

## Implementation

1. **Identify your target verticals:** Select 3-5 industries where you have at least 2-3 referenceable customers each. Prioritize verticals with the highest deal values, shortest sales cycles, and strongest ICP fit. Trying to verticalize for an industry where you have zero customers undermines credibility.
2. **Interview customers for vertical-specific details:** Go beyond standard case study interviews. Ask about industry-specific challenges (regulatory requirements, seasonal patterns, industry benchmarks), integration requirements unique to their tech stack, and metrics that their peers care about. A healthcare case study should reference readmission rates, not just "operational efficiency."
3. **Structure for the vertical audience:** Use the vertical's language and frameworks. Lead with the industry challenge (not your product), show the evaluation process (what alternatives they considered and why they chose you), detail the implementation with vertical-specific nuances (compliance requirements met, integrations built), and close with results using industry-standard KPIs.
4. **Create multiple formats per case study:** Build a detailed PDF (2-3 pages) for late-stage deals, a one-page summary for email attachments and sales decks, a web page version for SEO and paid traffic, a 90-second video testimonial for social and events, and pull quotes for ad creative. One customer interview should yield 5+ content assets.
5. **Distribute through vertical-specific channels:** Publish case studies on your website organized by industry (not just a generic case study page). Include them in industry-specific email nurtures, sales sequences for vertical-targeted accounts, vertical trade publication placements, and industry conference presentations.

## Key Metrics

- **Case Study Influence Rate** — percentage of closed-won deals where the prospect engaged with a verticalized case study during the buying cycle; target 40-60%
- **Vertical Page Conversion Rate** — conversion rate of industry-specific case study pages vs. generic case study pages; verticalized pages typically convert 2-3x higher
- **Sales Rep Usage Rate** — percentage of sales reps who actively share verticalized case studies in their sequences; if reps are not using them, the content is not resonating with their conversations

## Best Practices

- Name the customer and include their logo — anonymous case studies ("A major healthcare provider") convert at half the rate of named ones. If the customer cannot be named, get permission to use their logo and industry at minimum.
- Include a specific quote from a titled executive at the customer — "Our CFO said..." carries more weight than a generic employee testimonial. Executive quotes signal organizational commitment.
- Update case studies annually with fresh metrics — a case study from three years ago signals stagnation. Adding "After two years, results have compounded to..." keeps the content current and shows sustained value.
- Build a vertical case study matrix and identify gaps — if you are targeting five industries and only have case studies for three, the missing two represent a content priority, not a marketing gap you can work around

## Common Pitfalls

- Writing case studies that read like product documentation — the story should center on the customer's journey and results, not on your product's features. The product is the supporting character, not the protagonist.
- Creating only one case study per vertical — a single proof point is an anecdote. Two or three case studies in the same vertical demonstrate a pattern and establish vertical expertise.
- Burying vertical case studies in a generic library — if a healthcare prospect has to scroll past manufacturing and retail case studies to find the healthcare one, most will leave. Organize your website and sales materials so vertical content is immediately accessible.
