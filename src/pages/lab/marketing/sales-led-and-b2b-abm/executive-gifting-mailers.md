# Executive Gifting & Mailers

Executive gifting and direct mail campaigns use physical objects — gifts, handwritten notes, custom packages, or branded mailers — to capture the attention of senior decision-makers who are unreachable through digital channels. In an era where C-suite executives receive hundreds of emails daily but only a handful of pieces of physical mail, a well-executed gifting campaign achieves 60-80% open rates and 15-25% meeting booking rates, far exceeding any digital outreach channel.

## Core Concept

Physical mail and gifts work because they create a reciprocity effect — when someone receives something thoughtful, they feel a social obligation to respond. This is not about bribery; it is about demonstrating effort and personalization at a level that digital outreach cannot match. A custom-printed book relevant to the executive's published interests, a handwritten note referencing their recent keynote, or a curated gift box tied to your brand story all communicate "we invested real time in understanding you" in a way that no email template can replicate.

## Implementation

1. **Select your target list carefully:** Executive gifting is expensive ($50-$500+ per touch). Reserve it for Tier 1 accounts with high deal potential and senior contacts who have not responded to digital outreach. Target 25-50 executives maximum per campaign to maintain quality and budget control.
2. **Research each recipient:** Before selecting a gift, research the executive's interests, recent public statements, LinkedIn activity, and company initiatives. The gift should feel personally chosen, not randomly assigned. If the CEO recently spoke about sustainability, a premium reusable product with a handwritten note referencing that talk is far more impactful than a generic gift card.
3. **Design the mailer experience:** The unboxing should tell a story. Use high-quality packaging, a handwritten note (or convincingly hand-written by a service like Handwrytten), the gift itself, and a clear next step — a personalized URL, a QR code to a custom video message, or a booking link. The CTA should feel like an invitation, not a demand.
4. **Time the send strategically:** Coordinate physical mail with digital touchpoints. Send the mailer, then follow up via email 3-5 days later referencing it: "I sent you something earlier this week — did it arrive?" This multi-channel approach doubles response rates compared to the mailer alone.
5. **Track delivery and response:** Use tracked shipping (FedEx, UPS) to confirm delivery dates. Log the send in your CRM and trigger the follow-up sequence based on confirmed delivery, not send date. Measure meeting booked rate, pipeline created, and cost per meeting to evaluate ROI.

## Key Metrics

- **Delivery-to-Response Rate** — percentage of confirmed deliveries that result in an email reply, LinkedIn response, or meeting booking; benchmark is 15-25%
- **Cost Per Meeting** — total campaign cost (gifts, shipping, creative, follow-up) divided by meetings booked; expect $200-$800 per meeting for C-suite targets
- **Pipeline Influenced** — total pipeline generated from accounts engaged through gifting campaigns; should be measured over a 90-day attribution window

## Best Practices

- Pair every gift with a handwritten note that demonstrates genuine research — "I read your piece on [topic] and thought this would resonate" is infinitely more effective than "We would love to connect"
- Make the gift useful or consumable, not branded swag — no one wants another branded water bottle. High-quality food, a book relevant to their role, a premium item related to a known hobby, or a charitable donation in their name all outperform branded merchandise.
- Include a frictionless CTA — a Calendly link or "reply to this note" is better than asking them to fill out a form. The response mechanism should match the personal tone of the gift.
- Use gifting platforms (Sendoso, Postal, Reachdesk) to manage inventory, shipping, and CRM integration at scale rather than manually shipping each package

## Common Pitfalls

- Sending gifts that feel like bribery rather than thoughtfulness — a $200 gift card to someone you have never met comes across as transactional. The gift should show effort and relevance, not raw dollar value.
- Gifting without follow-up — the gift opens the door, but the follow-up books the meeting. Without a coordinated email and call sequence after delivery, most gifts generate a moment of appreciation and nothing else.
- Ignoring corporate gift policies — many large enterprises have policies that prohibit accepting gifts above a certain threshold ($25-$50 is common). Research the company's policy before sending, or default to lower-value, high-thoughtfulness items.
