# Multithreading Sequences

Multithreading sequences run coordinated outreach to multiple contacts within a target account simultaneously — the economic buyer, the technical evaluator, the end user champion, and the executive sponsor. B2B deals involving three or more contacts close at 2-3x the rate of single-threaded deals, and multithreaded opportunities are 50% less likely to stall in pipeline. The goal is to build consensus across the buying committee, not just convince one champion to sell internally.

## Core Concept

In B2B sales, the average enterprise deal involves 6-10 stakeholders. When your entire relationship depends on a single contact, you are exposed to champion risk — if they change roles, lose political capital, or simply get busy, the deal dies. Multithreading eliminates this single point of failure by engaging multiple stakeholders with role-appropriate messaging. The CFO gets ROI analysis. The VP of Engineering gets technical architecture. The end users get workflow improvements. Each thread reinforces the others, building organizational momentum toward a purchase decision.

## Implementation

1. **Map the buying committee:** For each target account, identify 4-6 contacts across the decision-making roles: economic buyer (approves budget), technical evaluator (assesses product fit), user champion (will use the product daily), executive sponsor (strategic alignment), and procurement/legal (contract terms). Use LinkedIn Sales Navigator, organizational charts, and your champion's input to build this map.
2. **Create role-specific messaging sequences:** Build distinct email and call sequences for each buying role. The economic buyer sequence leads with ROI, cost reduction, and competitive positioning. The technical evaluator sequence leads with architecture, integration, and security. The end user sequence leads with usability, workflow improvement, and adoption stories.
3. **Coordinate timing and reference each other:** Do not blast all contacts simultaneously — this feels like spam and triggers internal conversations that may work against you. Sequence outreach so the champion is contacted first, then the technical evaluator 2-3 days later with a reference to the champion's conversation, then the economic buyer the following week with a tailored business case.
4. **Use warm introductions where possible:** After establishing rapport with your champion, ask them to introduce you to other stakeholders. A warm intro converts to a meeting at 5-10x the rate of a cold email to the same person. If a warm intro is not possible, reference the existing conversation: "I have been speaking with [Champion Name] about [topic]."
5. **Track multithreading depth per deal:** Add a field to your CRM that tracks the number of unique engaged contacts per opportunity. Set a minimum threshold — for example, require at least 3 engaged contacts before moving a deal to the "proposal" stage. This creates a structural requirement for multithreading.

## Key Metrics

- **Average Contacts Engaged Per Opportunity** — number of unique contacts with meaningful engagement (meeting, email reply, content download) per open deal; target is 3-5 for mid-market, 5-8 for enterprise
- **Multithreaded Win Rate** — close rate of opportunities with 3+ engaged contacts vs. those with 1-2; expect a 2-3x difference
- **Deal Velocity by Thread Count** — average sales cycle length segmented by number of engaged contacts; more threads typically means faster deals because consensus builds in parallel rather than sequentially

## Best Practices

- Give each contact a unique value proposition — the reason you are reaching out to the CFO should be meaningfully different from why you are reaching out to the end user. Same product, different story.
- Track and share engagement signals across threads — if the technical evaluator downloads a security whitepaper, the rep reaching out to the CISO should know and reference it
- Use LinkedIn connection requests as a parallel channel — many stakeholders who ignore cold emails will accept a LinkedIn request from someone who is already working with their colleague
- Build mutual action plans that list all stakeholders by name — this formalizes the multithread and makes it visible to everyone involved in the deal

## Common Pitfalls

- Contacting multiple people with the same generic email — if the CFO and the VP of Engineering receive identical outreach, it undermines credibility and signals a spray-and-pray approach
- Going over the champion's head without their awareness — reaching out to their boss before discussing it with them can destroy the relationship. Always inform your champion before engaging their leadership.
- Multithreading too late in the deal — starting to engage other stakeholders in the final stages creates the impression of desperation. Begin multithreading in the discovery phase.
