## Why launch a logbook now

Every mission starts with a manifest. This blog is mine—a running log of experiments, design exercises, and telemetry pulled
from projects that orbit analytics, growth, and creative technology. Until now those notes lived in offline documents and desk
sketches. Publishing them here keeps the process transparent and invites collaboration.

## What you will find here

Expect deep dives into instrumentation sandboxes, visual studies inspired by 1970s NASA documentation, and postmortems on lab
builds. Each entry will include the same supporting materials I lean on internally: measurement plans, interface schematics,
and screenshots of in-flight prototypes.

## How to follow along

New posts will sync with major repository updates so the logbook mirrors the actual work. If something catches your eye, reach
out via the contact page—the goal is to keep this space as conversational as it is archival.
