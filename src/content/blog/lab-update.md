## Instrumentation prototypes on deck

The analytics wing now includes expanded GA4 scenarios, Tag Manager payload blueprints, and first-pass pixel sandboxes. Each
module mirrors production-grade markup so visitors can see the exact interactions, payloads, and console output that a real
deployment would generate.

## Visual polish and navigation

Alongside the instrumentation work, I have been extending the 1970s NASA aesthetic across lab layouts. Expect clearer section
dividers, typographic annotations, and breadcrumb trails so every experiment feels like part of a coordinated mission dossier.

## Next launch window

Upcoming iterations will focus on storytelling around the experiments: recorded walk-throughs, measurement plans you can copy,
and downloadable assets for A/B testing. The lab is officially open for observationâ€”thanks for following along.
